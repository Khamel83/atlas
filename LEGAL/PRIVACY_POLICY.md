# Privacy Policy - Atlas Knowledge Management System

## Data Processing Philosophy
Atlas is designed as a **local-first** system. All personal data remains on your device.

## What Data Is Processed
- Content you explicitly provide (articles, documents, etc.)
- Metadata about your content (timestamps, source URLs, etc.)
- Configuration settings and preferences
- Processing logs and error information

## Where Data Is Stored
- **Locally only**: All data stored in your configured data directory
- **No cloud storage**: No data transmitted to remote servers (except optional API calls you configure)
- **User-controlled**: You control all data storage locations and retention

## Third-Party Services
Atlas may use third-party APIs if you configure them:
- **OpenRouter/OpenAI**: For AI processing (if enabled)
- **External websites**: For content fetching
- **You are responsible** for compliance with all third-party terms of service

## Data Security
- **Your responsibility**: Secure your device and data directory
- **No encryption**: Atlas does not encrypt data at rest (you should use full-disk encryption)
- **API keys**: Store securely in .env files with proper file permissions

## Data Retention
- **User-controlled**: You decide what to keep and what to delete
- **No automatic deletion**: Atlas preserves all data unless you remove it
- **Export capability**: All data stored in standard formats (Markdown, JSON)

## Changes to This Policy
This policy may be updated. Check the repository for the latest version.
