# Compliance Notes for Atlas Users

## API Usage Compliance
If you configure Atlas to use external APIs, you must:
- **Read and follow** all terms of service for each API
- **Respect rate limits** and usage restrictions
- **Manage your own API keys** securely
- **Monitor your usage** to avoid violations

### Common API Considerations
- **OpenAI/OpenRouter**: Review their usage policies and data handling practices
- **Website scraping**: Respect robots.txt and terms of service
- **YouTube API**: Follow YouTube's API terms of service

## Content Legality
You are responsible for ensuring:
- **Legal right to access** all content you process
- **Copyright compliance** when saving or processing copyrighted material
- **Fair use considerations** for any content analysis or transformation
- **Personal data protection** if processing others' personal information

## Data Privacy Laws
Depending on your jurisdiction, consider:
- **GDPR compliance** (EU users)
- **CCPA compliance** (California users)
- **Other local privacy laws**

Atlas processes data locally, which generally provides better privacy compliance, but you remain responsible for legal compliance.

## Security Considerations
- **Use full-disk encryption** on devices running Atlas
- **Secure your .env files** with appropriate file permissions
- **Regular backups** of your data directory
- **Keep software updated** including Python and dependencies

## Export and Portability
Atlas stores data in standard formats (Markdown, JSON) to ensure:
- **Data portability**: Easy to export and migrate
- **No vendor lock-in**: Can switch to other tools
- **Long-term accessibility**: Standard formats remain readable

## Reporting Issues
For security vulnerabilities or legal concerns:
- **Check documentation** first for known issues
- **Community resources** for general questions
- **No official support** is provided by the authors

## International Use
If using Atlas internationally:
- **Local laws apply**: Follow laws in your jurisdiction
- **Export restrictions**: Be aware of software export restrictions
- **Data transfer laws**: Consider if any data crosses borders via APIs
