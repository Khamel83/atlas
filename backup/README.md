# Atlas Backup System

This directory contains all backup components for the Atlas system, including database backups, OCI storage backups, local sync backups, and restore functionality.

## Components

### Database Backup (`database_backup.py`)
- Creates PostgreSQL backup script with pg_dump
- Implements daily automated database backups
- Sets up backup compression and encryption
- Configures backup retention (keep last 30 days)
- Creates backup verification script
- Adds cron job for daily backup execution

### OCI Storage Backup (`oci_storage_backup.py`)
- Sets up OCI Object Storage bucket (free tier)
- Installs and configures OCI CLI
- Creates script to upload backups to OCI Object Storage
- Implements backup rotation in object storage (30 days)
- Adds backup success/failure email notifications
- Tests backup upload and cleanup processes

### Local Machine Backup Sync (`local_sync_backup.py`)
- Creates rsync script for critical data to personal machine
- Sets up SSH key authentication for secure backup transfer
- Configures selective backup (database dumps + critical configs)
- Implements backup scheduling (weekly to personal machine)
- Creates local backup verification and cleanup
- Adds backup monitoring and email alerts

### Restore System (`restore_system.py`)
- Creates restore script that works from any backup
- Implements database restore from backup files
- Builds configuration restore functionality
- Adds backup listing and selection interface
- Creates disaster recovery documentation
- Tests full system restore from backup
