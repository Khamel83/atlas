# Spec: Production-Ready Milestone

**Date**: 2025-08-23

**Status**: Proposed

## 1. Overview

This specification outlines the necessary steps to bring the Atlas project to a production-ready state. The goal is to create a stable, reliable, and well-documented system that can be easily set up and maintained by a new user with no prior context.

This plan is broken down into four phases, as approved in the high-level roadmap:
*   **Phase 1: Critical Fixes & Core Functionality Validation**
*   **Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing & Hardening**
*   **Phase 3: Documentation, Refactoring & Usability**
*   **Phase 4: Final Review & Production Readiness**

## 2. Phase 1: Critical Fixes & Core Functionality Validation

### 2.1. Fix Document Content Extraction

*   **Requirement:** Resolve the critical bug where 18,575 documents have metadata but no content.
*   **Success Criteria:** All 18,575 documents are re-processed, and at least 90% of them have their full content extracted and stored in the database.

### 2.2. Improve Article Fetching

*   **Requirement:** Improve the success rate of article fetching from 50% to at least 85%.
*   **Success Criteria:** The article fetching pipeline is enhanced to handle paywalls and other fetching issues more effectively, and the success rate is demonstrably improved to over 85% on a sample of 100 failed articles.

### 2.3. Implement Instapaper Processing

*   **Requirement:** Implement the missing Instapaper processing pipeline.
*   **Success Criteria:** The Instapaper pipeline is fully functional, and all articles from a sample Instapaper export are successfully processed and stored in the database.

### 2.4. End-to-End Core Functionality Test

*   **Requirement:** Perform a full, end-to-end test of the core functionality (articles, podcasts, documents, Instapaper).
*   **Success Criteria:** A comprehensive test suite is created and run, demonstrating that all core functionalities are working as expected.

## 3. Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing & Hardening

### 3.1. Dependency Audit

*   **Requirement:** Review and validate all project dependencies.
*   **Success Criteria:** All dependencies are documented, and any unused or outdated dependencies are removed.

### 3.2. Environment Variable Validation

*   **Requirement:** Document and validate all environment variables.
*   **Success Criteria:** All environment variables are documented in a `.env.example` file, and a validation script is created to ensure all required variables are set.

### 3.3. Unit & Integration Testing

*   **Requirement:** Write and run unit and integration tests for all major components.
*   **Success Criteria:** The test suite is expanded to cover all major components, and the overall test coverage is increased to at least 80%.

### 3.4. System-Wide Stress Testing

*   **Requirement:** Perform stress testing to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
*   **Success Criteria:** A stress testing plan is created and executed, and any identified performance bottlenecks are addressed.

## 4. Phase 3: Documentation, Refactoring & Usability

### 4.1. Code Refactoring & Cleanup

*   **Requirement:** Refactor the codebase for clarity, consistency, and maintainability.
*   **Success Criteria:** The codebase is refactored to adhere to a consistent style guide, and any complex or confusing code is simplified and documented.

### 4.2. Comprehensive Documentation

*   **Requirement:** Create detailed documentation for all components, including a "zero-questions" setup guide for new users.
*   **Success Criteria:** The documentation is updated to be comprehensive and easy to understand, and a new user can set up and run the project without asking any questions.

### 4.3. GitHub Presence

*   **Requirement:** Update the `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and other GitHub-facing documentation to be clear and comprehensive.
*   **Success Criteria:** The GitHub repository is updated to be professional and welcoming to new users and contributors.

## 5. Phase 4: Final Review & Production Readiness

### 5.1. Final "Zero-Questions" Review

*   **Requirement:** A full review of the project from the perspective of a new user to ensure the documentation is complete and the system is easy to set up and run.
*   **Success Criteria:** A new user can successfully set up and run the project without any assistance.

### 5.2. Final End-to-End Testing

*   **Requirement:** One final, full end-to-end test of the entire system.
*   **Success Criteria:** The final end-to-end test passes without any errors.

### 5.3. Production Deployment Plan

*   **Requirement:** Create a detailed plan for deploying the application to a production environment.
*   **Success Criteria:** A detailed deployment plan is created, including instructions for setting up a production server, configuring the application, and monitoring the system.
