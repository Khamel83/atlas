# Spec: System Completion Master Plan

**Project:** TrojanHorse
**Date:** 2025-07-31
**Author:** Gemini Agent

## 1. Overview

This specification is the master plan for completing the current development phase of the TrojanHorse project. It does not contain direct implementation tasks itself. Instead, it serves as a high-level orchestrator, defining the sequential order in which the other feature and technical debt specifications should be executed.

The purpose of this master plan is to provide a single, unambiguous entry point for a development agent, ensuring that all planned work is carried out in a logical and structured manner.

## 2. Execution Order

The development will proceed in the following order:

1.  **Foundational Enhancements:** First, address all technical debt to ensure the codebase is stable, robust, and secure. This provides a solid foundation for new features.
2.  **Advanced Analytics:** Second, build the new user-facing analytics dashboard. This is a major new capability for the user.
3.  **Workflow Integration:** Finally, build the hotkey-based workflow integration. This feature builds upon the stable, enhanced system.

## 3. How to Use This Document

The development agent should begin by opening the `tasks.md` file associated with this specification. The tasks in that file will point to the `tasks.md` files of the other specifications, which should be executed in the order listed.

Upon completion of all tasks in this master plan, the planned development cycle is considered finished and the project is ready for user testing and feedback.
