# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Code Quality Improvements and Documentation Enhancements
> Created: 2025-08-12
> Status: Planning

## Overview

This spec outlines improvements to code quality, documentation, and test coverage for the Atlas project. These enhancements will increase maintainability, reliability, and developer experience while aligning with the project's goal of creating a production-ready system.

## User Stories

### Future Developer/AI Agent

As a future developer or AI agent taking over this project, I want comprehensive inline documentation, clear code structure, and extensive test coverage so that I can understand, modify, and extend the system without requiring extensive reverse engineering.

**Detailed Workflow**: I review the codebase and immediately understand the purpose of each module through clear naming, inline documentation, and comprehensive tests. I can confidently make changes knowing that tests will catch regressions and documentation will guide me through complex areas.

### Personal Knowledge Curator

As a personal knowledge curator, I want a reliable and maintainable system so that I can trust Atlas to process and preserve my knowledge base for years without requiring constant attention or breaking due to code changes.

**Detailed Workflow**: I deploy Atlas and it continues to work reliably over time. When updates are needed, I can apply them with confidence because the code is well-structured and tested, reducing the risk of breaking existing functionality.

## Spec Scope

1. **Code Documentation Enhancement** - Add comprehensive inline documentation to explain complex logic and implementation details
2. **Test Coverage Expansion** - Implement additional unit and integration tests for core functionality
3. **Code Quality Improvements** - Refactor complex areas for better readability and maintainability
4. **API Documentation Enhancement** - Improve documentation of REST API endpoints and web dashboard features
5. **Development Workflow Optimization** - Enhance development tooling and processes for better code quality

## Out of Scope

- Major architectural changes or feature additions
- Performance optimizations beyond basic code readability
- UI/UX improvements to the web dashboard
- External dependency updates or upgrades

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Well-Documented Codebase** - All core modules have comprehensive inline documentation explaining purpose, parameters, and implementation details
2. **Expanded Test Coverage** - Significant increase in test coverage for core functionality, especially cognitive amplification features
3. **Improved Code Quality** - Refactored complex areas for better readability and maintainability
4. **Enhanced API Documentation** - Complete documentation of all REST API endpoints with examples
5. **Optimized Development Workflow** - Improved tooling and processes for maintaining code quality
