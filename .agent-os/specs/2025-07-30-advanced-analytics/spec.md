## Overview

Implement advanced analytics capabilities to provide cross-day pattern recognition and deeper insights from transcribed conversations.

## User Stories

### Trend Identification

As a user, I want to identify recurring themes or trends across my conversations over time, so that I can gain a better understanding of my work patterns.

### Productivity Insights

As a user, I want to receive insights into my communication habits and productivity based on my transcribed conversations, so that I can optimize my workflow.

## Spec Scope

1. **Pattern Recognition:** Develop algorithms to identify recurring patterns, topics, and sentiment across multiple days or weeks of conversations.
2. **Insight Generation:** Generate actionable insights based on the identified patterns (e.g., "You spend 30% of your meeting time discussing X topic").
3. **Reporting:** Provide text-based reports summarizing key analytics and insights.

## Out of Scope

- Complex data visualization.
- Predictive analytics.

## Expected Deliverable

1. A new `analytics.py` module that contains the advanced analytics logic.
2. The ability to generate text-based reports on communication patterns and productivity insights.
3. The analytics will be based on the existing transcribed data in the SQLite database.
