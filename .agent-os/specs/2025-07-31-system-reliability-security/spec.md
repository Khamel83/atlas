# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: System Reliability & Security Hardening
> Created: 2025-07-31
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Address critical reliability and security issues identified in comprehensive audit to ensure production-ready system stability, security, and maintainability.

## User Stories

### System Administrator Story

As a system administrator, I want the TrojanHorse system to have robust error handling and secure database operations, so that the system runs reliably in production without security vulnerabilities or unexpected crashes.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Database connections are properly managed with connection pooling and cleanup
- All user inputs are validated and SQL queries are parameterized
- Error conditions are handled gracefully with appropriate logging
- System failures are recoverable without data corruption

### Developer Story

As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage and standardized error handling, so that I can maintain and extend the system confidently without introducing regressions.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Unit tests cover all critical components (audio_capture, transcribe, web_interface)
- Error handling patterns are consistent across all modules
- Code follows security best practices
- System behavior is predictable and well-documented

## Spec Scope

1. **Database Connection Management** - Implement proper connection pooling, cleanup, and error handling for all SQLite operations
2. **Security Hardening** - Add input validation, SQL parameterization, and eliminate injection vulnerabilities
3. **Error Handling Standardization** - Create consistent error handling patterns across all modules with proper logging
4. **Test Coverage Expansion** - Add comprehensive unit tests for audio_capture, transcribe, web_interface modules
5. **Security Audit Implementation** - Review and fix all security vulnerabilities identified in audit

## Out of Scope

- New feature development
- UI/UX changes
- Performance optimizations beyond security requirements
- Third-party service integrations

## Expected Deliverable

1. All database operations use proper connection management with no resource leaks
2. All user inputs validated and SQL queries parameterized against injection attacks
3. Consistent error handling patterns implemented across all modules
4. Test coverage expanded to >80% for critical components with all tests passing
5. Security audit completed with all high/critical vulnerabilities resolved
