### Task 2.3: Enhanced Error Detection
**Estimated**: 1 hour
**Priority**: Medium

- [ ] Implement robust authentication success detection
- [ ] Add specific paywall content detection
- [ ] Improve logging for authentication attempts

- [ ] Ensure no sensitive credential logging

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Clear detection of successful vs failed authentication
- No false positives (claiming success when still paywalled)
- Rich logging without exposing credentials
- Metrics suitable for monitoring and improvement

**Files to Modify**:
- `helpers/article_strategies.py`

### Task 2.4: Multi-Site Framework
**Estimated**: 0.5-1 hour
**Priority**: Low

- [ ] Create extensible base class for site authentication
- [ ] Add configuration-driven authentication flows
- [ ] Prepare framework for additional sites (Bloomberg, Economist)
- [ ] Document how to add new paywall sites

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Easy to add new paywall sites with minimal code changes
- Configuration-driven approach for site-specific settings
- Clear documentation for extending to new sites

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `helpers/auth_base.py` (new)
- `helpers/article_strategies.py` (refactor to use base class)

## Phase 3: Integration and Testing (2-3 hours)

### Task 3.1: Comprehensive Testing
**Estimated**: 1.5 hours
**Priority**: High

- [ ] Test authentication with real credentials
- [ ] Verify full content retrieval for multiple articles
- [ ] Test fallback behavior when authentication fails
- [ ] Performance testing with rate limiting
- [ ] Test session persistence across multiple fetches

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- >80% authentication success rate for both sites
- Full article content (>15,000 chars) when authentication succeeds
- Graceful fallback to Enhanced Wayback when auth fails
- No impact on overall system performance

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `test_paywall_authentication.py` (new)

### Task 3.2: Production Integration
**Estimated**: 0.5-1 hour
**Priority**: High

- [ ] Update main ingestion pipeline to use enhanced authentication

*These tasks implement the paywall authentication enhancement while maintaining Atlas's core principle of never losing data through robust fallback strategies.*
