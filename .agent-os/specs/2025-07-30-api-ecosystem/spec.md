## Overview

Implement a robust API ecosystem to allow external tools and services to integrate with TrojanHorse, enabling broader functionality and extensibility.

## User Stories

### Third-Party Integration

As a developer, I want to be able to integrate my applications with TrojanHorse's data and functionality through a well-documented API, so that I can build custom solutions.

### Custom Dashboards

As a user, I want to be able to create custom dashboards or reports using data from TrojanHorse via its API, so that I can visualize my insights in a personalized way.

## Spec Scope

1. **RESTful API:** Design and implement a RESTful API for accessing transcribed data, analysis results, and core functionalities.
2. **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for API access.
3. **API Documentation:** Provide comprehensive API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger).
4. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

## Out of Scope

- Building a full-fledged developer portal.
- Monetization of API access.

## Expected Deliverable

1. A new `api.py` module that contains the API endpoints and logic.
2. Secure and documented API endpoints for core TrojanHorse functionalities.
3. Rate limiting for API access.
