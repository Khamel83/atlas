# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-multi-device-sync/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- The `sync.py` module will implement a peer-to-peer communication protocol (e.g., using `socket` or a higher-level library like `zeromq`).
- Data will be exchanged in an encrypted format (e.g., using `PyNaCl` for NaCL or `cryptography` for AES).
- Conflict resolution will be handled using a last-write-wins or merge-based strategy.
- The module will expose functions for:
  - `start_sync_server(port: int)`: Starts a server to listen for incoming sync requests.
  - `connect_to_peer(ip_address: str, port: int)`: Connects to a peer device.
  - `send_data(data: bytes)`: Sends encrypted data to a connected peer.
  - `receive_data() -> bytes`: Receives and decrypts data from a peer.
  - `resolve_conflict(local_data: dict, remote_data: dict) -> dict`: Resolves data conflicts.

## External Dependencies

- **PyNaCl (or cryptography):** Python library for network and cryptographic primitives.
  - **Justification:** Required for data encryption during transit.
- **zeromq (optional):** High-performance asynchronous messaging library.
  - **Justification:** Could be used for more robust peer-to-peer communication.
