# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Multi-device Sync
> Created: 2025-07-30
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement multi-device synchronization capabilities to allow users to access and manage their transcribed conversations across different devices (e.g., Mac Mini + Raspberry Pi).

## User Stories

### Seamless Access

As a user, I want to seamlessly access my transcribed conversations and analysis results from any of my devices, so that I can work from anywhere.

### Data Consistency

As a user, I want to ensure that my data is consistent across all my devices, so that I don't have to worry about data loss or discrepancies.

## Spec Scope

1. **Peer-to-Peer Sync:** Implement a peer-to-peer synchronization mechanism between devices.
2. **Conflict Resolution:** Develop strategies for resolving data conflicts during synchronization.
3. **Data Encryption:** Ensure that data is encrypted during transit and at rest on all devices.

## Out of Scope

- Cloud-based synchronization services.
- Real-time collaboration features.

## Expected Deliverable

1. A new `sync.py` module that contains the multi-device synchronization logic.
2. The ability to synchronize transcribed data and analysis results between two or more devices.
3. Data consistency and encryption during synchronization.
