# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Atlas Production-Ready System
> Created: 2025-08-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Transform Atlas from its current functional state into a fully production-ready personal cognitive amplification platform with comprehensive testing, documentation, automation, and deployment capabilities. This encompasses infrastructure stabilization, feature completion, production hardening, and creation of a maintainable system that can operate reliably for years with minimal intervention.

## User Stories

### Personal Knowledge Curator

As a personal knowledge curator, I want to deploy Atlas on my Raspberry Pi and have it automatically ingest content from all my sources (articles, YouTube, podcasts) so that I can build a comprehensive personal knowledge base without manual intervention.

**Detailed Workflow**: I configure my content sources once, deploy to my Raspberry Pi, and Atlas runs continuously, processing new content, generating insights, and making everything searchable through the web dashboard. The system handles failures gracefully and provides clear status updates.

### Future Developer/AI Agent

As a future developer or AI agent taking over this project, I want comprehensive documentation and clear task breakdowns so that I can understand the system architecture, current state, and next steps without requiring the original developer's knowledge.

**Detailed Workflow**: I review the master documentation, understand the current phase and completed tasks, identify the next atomic task to execute, and proceed with confidence knowing all context and requirements are clearly documented.

### Personal API Consumer

As a developer of my own tools, I want a comprehensive REST API from Atlas so that I can integrate cognitive amplification features into my other personal projects and build custom workflows around my knowledge base.

**Detailed Workflow**: I access Atlas through documented API endpoints to retrieve insights, search content, and trigger cognitive functions from my custom applications and scripts.

## Spec Scope

1. **Infrastructure Stabilization** - Complete environment setup automation, testing infrastructure, deployment procedures, and configuration management
2. **Feature Completion** - Implement all cognitive amplification features to full production quality with comprehensive error handling
3. **Production Hardening** - Add monitoring, logging, security, backup/restore, and automated maintenance procedures
4. **API Development** - Create comprehensive REST API with full documentation and authentication for integration with other personal projects
5. **Documentation & Automation** - Generate complete documentation, setup guides, maintenance procedures, and GitHub automation workflows
6. **Performance Optimization** - Implement caching, search indexing, memory management, and scalability for large personal knowledge bases
7. **Deployment & Operations** - Create production deployment for Raspberry Pi with monitoring, automated updates, and maintenance procedures

## Out of Scope

- Multi-user functionality or team collaboration features
- Enterprise features like advanced user management or commercial licensing
- Cloud hosting or SaaS deployment options
- Advanced machine learning model training (using existing models only)
- Integration with commercial knowledge management platforms
- Advanced visualization or dashboard customization beyond functional needs

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Fully Functional Production System** - Atlas running reliably on Raspberry Pi with all features working, comprehensive error handling, and automated maintenance
2. **Complete API Documentation** - REST API with full endpoint documentation, authentication, and integration examples for personal projects
3. **Comprehensive Setup Documentation** - New installation guide that gets system running in under 30 minutes with clear troubleshooting procedures
4. **Automated Development Workflow** - GitHub integration with automated testing, documentation updates, and deployment procedures that support intermittent development cycles
5. **Performance-Optimized System** - Handles large knowledge bases (10,000+ items) with fast search, efficient processing, and minimal resource usage on Raspberry Pi hardware
