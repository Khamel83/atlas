# Task Execution Framework

This document defines the methodology for reliably executing Atlas's 208 atomic tasks, ensuring consistent quality and progress tracking.

## Task Execution Methodology

### Task Types & Execution Patterns

#### **Type 1: Test-First Implementation (TFI)**
*Pattern: Write tests → Implement → Verify*
```
Examples: Tasks 1.1, 2.1, 6.1, 11.1
Duration: 2-8 hours
Success Rate: High (test-driven clarity)
```

**Execution Steps:**
1. **Understand Requirements** (15 min): Read task description and acceptance criteria
2. **Write Failing Tests** (45-90 min): Create comprehensive test cases
3. **Implement Solution** (60-240 min): Build functionality to pass tests
4. **Verify & Document** (30 min): Ensure tests pass, update docs

#### **Type 2: Configuration & Setup (CAS)**
*Pattern: Research → Configure → Validate → Document*
```
Examples: Tasks 1.2, 7.2, 16.2, 19.2
Duration: 1-4 hours
Success Rate: Medium (external dependencies)
```

**Execution Steps:**
1. **Research Requirements** (30 min): Understand what needs to be configured
2. **Apply Configuration** (60-120 min): Make necessary changes
3. **Validation Testing** (30-60 min): Verify configuration works
4. **Documentation Update** (15-30 min): Record configuration decisions

#### **Type 3: Integration & Connection (IAC)**
*Pattern: Plan → Connect → Test → Optimize*
```
Examples: Tasks 8.2, 13.3, 15.2, 24.2
Duration: 3-12 hours
Success Rate: Low (complex interactions)
```

**Execution Steps:**
1. **Integration Planning** (60 min): Map connections and data flow
2. **Implement Connections** (120-480 min): Build integration points
3. **End-to-End Testing** (60-180 min): Test complete workflows
4. **Performance Optimization** (30-120 min): Address bottlenecks

#### **Type 4: Documentation & Process (DAP)**
*Pattern: Gather → Structure → Write → Validate*
```
Examples: Tasks 21.2, 21.5, 22.7, 23.7
Duration: 1-6 hours
Success Rate: High (straightforward execution)
```

**Execution Steps:**
1. **Content Gathering** (30-60 min): Collect information to document
2. **Structure Planning** (15-30 min): Organize information logically
3. **Writing & Formatting** (60-240 min): Create comprehensive documentation
4. **Accuracy Validation** (30-60 min): Verify documentation is correct

### Task Sizing Guidelines

#### **Small Tasks (S): 1-3 hours**
- Single file modifications
- Simple configuration changes
- Basic documentation updates
- Straightforward test writing

#### **Medium Tasks (M): 3-8 hours**
- Multi-file implementations
- Integration between 2-3 components
- Complex configuration setup
- Comprehensive testing

#### **Large Tasks (L): 8+ hours**
- System-wide changes
- Complex integrations
- Performance optimization
- End-to-end feature implementation

### Quality Standards

#### **Code Quality Requirements**
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% for new code
- **Type Annotations**: All functions must have type hints
- **Documentation**: All public functions documented
- **Code Style**: Black formatting, isort imports, mypy validation

#### **Documentation Quality Requirements**
- **Completeness**: All configuration options documented
- **Accuracy**: Documentation matches actual implementation
- **Examples**: Working code examples for all major features
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions included

#### **Integration Quality Requirements**
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with helpful error messages
- **Performance**: Response times within acceptable limits
- **Reliability**: Handles edge cases and failures appropriately
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and logging for production use

## Task Execution Workflow

### Pre-Task Checklist
- [ ] **Context Review**: Read task description and dependencies
- [ ] **Environment Validation**: Ensure development environment is ready
- [ ] **Dependency Check**: Verify prerequisite tasks are complete
- [ ] **Branch Creation**: Create feature branch for task work
- [ ] **Time Estimation**: Estimate actual time needed for task

### During Task Execution
- [ ] **Progress Logging**: Regular commits with descriptive messages
- [ ] **Issue Tracking**: Document blockers and decisions in comments
- [ ] **Quality Checks**: Run tests and linting throughout development
- [ ] **Documentation Updates**: Keep docs in sync with code changes

### Post-Task Validation
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria**: Verify all task requirements met
- [ ] **Quality Gates**: All tests pass, coverage maintained
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Verify task doesn't break existing functionality
- [ ] **Documentation Review**: Ensure documentation is accurate and complete
- [ ] **Git Workflow**: Clean commit history, proper merge to main
- [ ] **Progress Update**: Mark task complete in tracking system

### Failure Recovery Protocol

#### **Task Failure Categories**
1. **Blocker**: External dependency unavailable
2. **Scope Creep**: Task larger than anticipated
3. **Technical Debt**: Existing code issues prevent progress
4. **Knowledge Gap**: Missing expertise for task completion

#### **Recovery Actions**
- **Blocker**: Document issue, move to next independent task
- **Scope Creep**: Break task into smaller subtasks, complete incrementally
- **Technical Debt**: Create debt reduction task, address before continuing
- **Knowledge Gap**: Research phase, create learning task if needed

## Context Management

### Task Context Package
Each task execution requires:
- **Task Description**: Clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Related Files**: List of files that will be modified
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites and blocking tasks
- **Test Strategy**: How to validate task completion
- **Integration Points**: How task connects to rest of system

### State Tracking
- **Current Phase**: Which of 6 phases is active
- **Active Tasks**: Which tasks are in progress
- **Completed Tasks**: Which tasks are fully done
- **Blocked Tasks**: Which tasks are waiting on dependencies
- **Failed Tasks**: Which tasks need attention or rework

### Knowledge Preservation
- **Decision Log**: Why specific approaches were chosen
- **Learning Outcomes**: What was discovered during implementation
- **Gotchas**: Tricky issues and their solutions
- **Performance Notes**: Optimization opportunities discovered

## Batch Execution Strategies

### Sprint Planning (1-2 week cycles)
- **Task Grouping**: Group related tasks for efficiency
- **Context Switching**: Minimize jumps between different areas
- **Risk Management**: Mix high-risk and low-risk tasks
- **Progress Validation**: Regular demos of working functionality

### Daily Execution (4-8 hour sessions)
- **Warm-up**: Start with documentation or small tasks
- **Deep Work**: Tackle complex implementation tasks
- **Integration**: Connect new work with existing system
- **Wrap-up**: Testing, documentation, progress updates

### Context-Aware Batching
- **Infrastructure Tasks**: Group environment, testing, deployment tasks
- **Feature Tasks**: Group related cognitive amplification features
- **API Tasks**: Group all API development work together
- **Documentation Tasks**: Group all documentation work together

This framework ensures that every task is executed with consistent quality standards while maintaining momentum across the 16-week development timeline.
