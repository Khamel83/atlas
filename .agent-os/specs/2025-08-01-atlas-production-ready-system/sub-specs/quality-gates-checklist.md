## Quality Gate Failure Recovery

### **Quality Gate Failure Process**
1. **Identify Root Cause**: Understand why quality gate failed
2. **Assess Impact**: Determine if failure is blocking or can be addressed later
3. **Create Recovery Plan**: Define specific steps to address quality issue
4. **Implement Fixes**: Make necessary changes to meet quality standards
5. **Re-validate**: Re-run quality gates to confirm issues resolved
6. **Document Learnings**: Record what was learned to prevent future failures

### **Common Quality Gate Failures**

#### **Test Coverage Below 90%**
- **Root Cause**: Insufficient test cases or untested edge cases
- **Recovery**: Write additional tests focusing on uncovered code paths
- **Prevention**: Write tests first, check coverage frequently during development

#### **Type Checking Failures**
- **Root Cause**: Missing type annotations or type inconsistencies
- **Recovery**: Add missing type annotations, fix type inconsistencies
- **Prevention**: Run mypy frequently during development, use strict mode

#### **Integration Failures**
- **Root Cause**: New code doesn't work properly with existing system
- **Recovery**: Debug integration points, fix interface mismatches
- **Prevention**: Test integration early and frequently, understand existing patterns

#### **Documentation Inaccuracy**
- **Root Cause**: Documentation doesn't match actual implementation
- **Recovery**: Update documentation to match implementation, verify examples work
- **Prevention**: Update documentation as part of code changes, validate examples

This quality gates checklist ensures that every task meets Atlas's high standards for reliability, maintainability, and production readiness.
