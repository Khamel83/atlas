# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Phase 3 - Search & Memory System
> Created: 2025-07-30
> Updated: 2025-07-31
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Overview

Implement comprehensive search and memory capabilities for the TrojanHorse Context Capture System. This completes the core system functionality by enabling fast keyword search, semantic search, and web-based browsing of all captured conversations.

## User Stories

### Remote Worker (Primary User)

As a remote worker, I want TrojanHorse to reliably capture all my audio conversations and provide searchable analysis, so that I never lose important context and can quickly retrieve past discussions.

The system must start recording on boot, survive crashes, and provide simple local/cloud analysis choices. I should be able to search all my conversations by keyword or concept without any technical complexity.

### System Reliability User

As someone who depends on context capture, I want the audio recording to work 100% of the time it's supposed to work, so that I never lose conversations due to technical failures.

If recording fails, I want immediate notification and automatic recovery. Everything else can be re-run later, but lost audio is lost forever.

### Long-term Knowledge Worker

As a knowledge worker building context over months, I want to search through all my transcribed conversations semantically and by timeline, so that I can find relevant discussions across weeks or months.

## Spec Scope

1. **Search Engine** - SQLite + FTS5 for fast keyword search across all transcripts
2. **Semantic Search** - Vector embeddings using sentence-transformers for conceptual queries
3. **Web Interface** - Clean browser-based search, browsing, and timeline view
4. **Batch Indexing** - Retroactively index all existing transcripts and analysis results
5. **Timeline Analysis** - Date-based filtering and conversation pattern visualization
6. **Export Capabilities** - Export search results and conversations in multiple formats

## Out of Scope

- Multi-device synchronization (Phase 4)
- Advanced analytics dashboard (Phase 4)
- Workflow integration APIs (Phase 4)
- Real-time collaboration features
- External tool integrations beyond basic search

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Fast Keyword Search** - SQLite FTS5 implementation with sub-second search across all transcripts
2. **Semantic Search** - Vector embedding search for conceptual and meaning-based queries
3. **Web Interface** - Clean, responsive browser interface for search and conversation browsing
4. **Timeline View** - Date-based filtering and conversation pattern visualization
5. **Batch Processing** - Index all existing transcripts and analysis results retroactively
6. **Export System** - Multiple export formats (JSON, CSV, Markdown) for search results
