# Docker & OCI Deployment for Personal Atlas

**Date**: August 18, 2025
**Status**: ðŸŽ¯ PLANNED
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Infrastructure Simplification
**Parent Task**: Personal Knowledge System Completion

## Executive Summary

Create Docker containerization for Atlas to enable **easy deployment, migration, and backup** across different environments. Focus on **personal use simplicity** - not enterprise features, just reliable containerized deployment for OCI and local development.

**Goal**: Make Atlas portable and easy to deploy anywhere via Docker, with simple backup/restore capabilities for personal knowledge preservation.

## Current Status Analysis

### âœ… What We Have
- Atlas system running natively on Ubuntu/OCI
- Background services, ingestion pipeline, search indexing operational
- Multiple dependencies (Python, SQLite, virtual environments)
- Manual setup and configuration process

### ðŸŽ¯ What We Need
- **Dockerized Atlas** with all dependencies included
- **Simple deployment** via docker-compose for OCI/local
- **Data persistence** with volume management
- **Backup/restore scripts** for knowledge preservation
- **Environment configuration** for different deployment scenarios

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Docker Container Creation (1 hour)
**Objective**: Create production-ready Docker container for Atlas

**Atomic Tasks**:
1. **Create Dockerfile** (`Dockerfile`)
   - Multi-stage build for optimized image size
   - Python environment with all Atlas dependencies
   - Background service initialization
   - Proper volume mounting for data persistence

2. **Docker-compose configuration** (`docker-compose.yml`)
   - Atlas service with environment variables
   - Volume mounts for data, logs, inputs
   - Port mapping for API access
   - Development vs production configurations

### Phase 2: OCI Optimization (0.5 hours)
**Objective**: Optimize Docker setup for OCI deployment

**Atomic Tasks**:
1. **OCI-specific configuration**
   - Environment variables for OCI networking
   - Resource limits appropriate for OCI instance
   - Persistent volume configuration
   - Auto-restart policies

2. **Deployment scripts** (`scripts/deploy-oci.sh`)
   - Automated Docker deployment to OCI
   - Environment setup and validation
   - Service health checks and monitoring

### Phase 3: Backup & Migration (0.5 hours)
**Objective**: Simple backup/restore for personal knowledge preservation

**Atomic Tasks**:
1. **Backup scripts** (`scripts/backup-atlas.sh`)
   - Export all Atlas data (database, processed content, configs)
   - Compressed backup with timestamp
   - Optional cloud storage upload (S3, GCS)

2. **Restore scripts** (`scripts/restore-atlas.sh`)
   - Fresh Atlas deployment from backup
   - Data integrity verification
   - Migration between different environments

## Expected Outcomes

### Deployment Simplification
- **One-command deployment**: `docker-compose up -d`
- **Environment portability**: Local dev â†’ OCI â†’ any Docker host
- **Consistent dependencies**: No more Python environment issues
- **Easy updates**: Pull new image, restart container

### Data Management
- **Persistent data**: All knowledge preserved in Docker volumes
- **Simple backups**: Scheduled backup scripts for knowledge preservation
- **Easy migration**: Move Atlas between servers via backup/restore
- **Version control**: Tag Docker images for rollback capability

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Dockerfile** (Multi-stage build)
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.11-slim as builder
   # Install dependencies, build Python packages

   FROM python:3.11-slim as runtime
   # Copy built packages, setup Atlas
   # Configure background services
   # Set up volume mounts
   ```

2. **Docker Compose** (`docker-compose.yml`)
   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     atlas:
       build: .
       volumes:
         - atlas_data:/app/data
         - atlas_logs:/app/logs
         - atlas_inputs:/app/inputs
       ports:
         - "5000:5000"
       environment:
         - ATLAS_ENV=production
   ```

3. **Deployment Scripts**
   ```bash
   deploy-oci.sh    # Deploy to OCI instance
   backup-atlas.sh  # Create knowledge backup
   restore-atlas.sh # Restore from backup
   ```

### Volume Management
- **atlas_data**: Databases, processed content, search indexes
- **atlas_logs**: Application logs and monitoring data
- **atlas_inputs**: Content input directory for ingestion
- **atlas_config**: Configuration files and environment settings

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Local deployment with debug settings
- **OCI Production**: Optimized for OCI instance deployment
- **Backup/Restore**: Portable configurations for migration

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Docker container runs Atlas with all features operational
- [ ] One-command deployment via docker-compose
- [ ] Data persistence works correctly across container restarts
- [ ] Backup/restore scripts preserve all knowledge content
- [ ] OCI deployment automated and reliable

## Implementation Complexity

- **Low complexity**: Standard Docker containerization patterns
- **No architectural changes**: Containerize existing Atlas system
- **Standard tools**: Docker, docker-compose, bash scripts
- **Personal focus**: Simple deployment, not enterprise orchestration

---

**Expected Impact**: Simplified deployment and management of Atlas with reliable backup/restore capabilities for personal knowledge preservation.

*This task focuses on infrastructure simplification for personal use, not enterprise container orchestration.*
