# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-workflow-integration/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- The `workflow.py` module will provide a framework for integrating with external productivity tools.
- It will include functions for:
  - `get_current_context() -> dict`: Retrieves information about the user's current active application and open documents (platform-specific implementation).
  - `send_task_to_tool(task_data: dict, tool_name: str)`: Sends task information to a specified productivity tool's API.
  - `send_notification(message: str)`: Displays a system notification.
- Integration with specific tools will be implemented as separate sub-modules or plugins within `workflow.py`.

## External Dependencies

- **pyautogui (conditional):** Python library for GUI automation, potentially for getting active window information.
  - **Justification:** May be required for cross-platform contextual awareness.
- **requests (conditional):** Python library for making HTTP requests.
  - **Justification:** Required for interacting with web-based productivity tool APIs.
