## Overview

Implement real-time context injection for work, allowing the system to integrate seamlessly with existing productivity workflows.

## User Stories

### Contextual Reminders

As a user, I want the system to provide contextual reminders based on my current work and past conversations, so that I don't miss important details.

### Automated Task Creation

As a user, I want the system to automatically create tasks in my project management tool based on action items identified in conversations, so that I can streamline my workflow.

## Spec Scope

1. **Contextual Awareness:** Develop a mechanism to understand the user's current work context (e.g., active application, open documents).
2. **Integration with Productivity Tools:** Implement integrations with popular productivity tools (e.g., task managers, note-taking apps).
3. **Real-time Notifications:** Provide real-time notifications or suggestions based on contextual analysis.

## Out of Scope

- Developing full-fledged integrations for every possible productivity tool.

## Expected Deliverable

1. A new `workflow.py` module that contains the workflow integration logic.
2. A framework for adding new integrations with productivity tools.
3. The ability to receive contextual reminders and automatically create tasks.
