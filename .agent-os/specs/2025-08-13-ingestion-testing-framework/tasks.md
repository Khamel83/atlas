# Ingestion Testing Framework Tasks

## Quick Start Tasks

### 1. Run Initial Testing Suite
**Priority: High**
**Estimated Time: 30 minutes**

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/dev/atlas
python testing/unified_testing_dashboard.py
```

**Expected Outcome**: Complete validation of all ingestion components with performance baselines.

### 2. Test Podcast Transcription with Your OPML
**Priority: High**
**Estimated Time: 25 minutes**

```bash
python testing/podcast_transcription_test.py
```

**Uses**: Your existing `inputs/podcasts.opml` file
**Expected Outcome**: Speed vs accuracy analysis for podcast transcription models.

### 3. Validate Search Quality
**Priority: Medium**
**Estimated Time: 15 minutes**

```bash
python testing/search_quality_analyzer.py
```

**Expected Outcome**: Minimum transcription quality requirements for effective search.

## Advanced Testing Tasks

### 4. Performance Benchmarking
**Priority: Medium**
**Estimated Time: 40 minutes**

```bash
python testing/performance_benchmarker.py
```

**Expected Outcome**: System resource usage analysis and optimization recommendations.

### 5. Ground Truth Setup
**Priority: Low**
**Estimated Time: 10 minutes**

```bash
python testing/ground_truth_setup.py
```

**Expected Outcome**: Test data with known transcripts for accuracy validation.

## Integration Tasks

### 6. Configure API Keys (Optional)
**Priority: Low**
**Estimated Time: 5 minutes**

Add to your environment or config:
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_key_here"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
export ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

**Expected Outcome**: Enhanced transcription options and comparison capabilities.

### 7. Set Transcription Preferences
**Priority: Medium**
**Estimated Time: 5 minutes**

In your config, set:
```json
{
  "transcription_model": "small",
  "run_transcription": true,
  "transcription_quality": "balanced"
}
```

**Expected Outcome**: Optimized transcription settings based on test results.

## Validation Tasks

### 8. Verify Installation Dependencies
**Priority: High**
**Estimated Time: 5 minutes**

```bash
pip install psutil  # For performance monitoring
# Ensure whisper is installed if using local transcription
```

### 9. Test with Real Data
**Priority: High**
**Estimated Time: Variable**

Use your actual podcast feeds and documents:
1. Backup existing output
2. Run comprehensive tests
3. Compare with baseline results

### 10. Review and Optimize
**Priority: Medium**
**Estimated Time: 20 minutes**

1. Review test results in `testing/dashboard/results/`
2. Implement recommended optimizations
3. Re-run tests to validate improvements

## Monitoring Tasks

### 11. Set Up Regular Testing
**Priority: Low**
**Estimated Time: 15 minutes**

Create cron job or script to run:
```bash
# Weekly comprehensive test
python testing/unified_testing_dashboard.py --mode=quick

# Daily transcription validation
python testing/podcast_transcription_test.py --limit=1
```

### 12. Track Performance Trends
**Priority: Low**
**Estimated Time: 5 minutes**

```bash
python testing/unified_testing_dashboard.py
# Select option 5: Show Trends
```

## Troubleshooting Tasks

### 13. Debug Failed Tests
**Priority: As Needed**

1. Check logs in `testing/*/logs/`
2. Verify dependencies and permissions
3. Test individual components

### 14. Optimize for Your Hardware
**Priority: As Needed**

Based on performance benchmark results:
1. Adjust concurrent processing limits
2. Optimize memory usage settings
3. Configure appropriate model sizes

## Production Readiness Tasks

### 15. Production Configuration
**Priority: Before Production**
**Estimated Time: 30 minutes**

1. Run full test suite with production config
2. Validate all error handling scenarios
3. Establish monitoring and alerting
4. Document operational procedures

### 16. Load Testing
**Priority: Before Production**
**Estimated Time: 60 minutes**

1. Test with large OPML files
2. Validate concurrent user scenarios
3. Test system limits and failover

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Run the unified testing dashboard** to get comprehensive system validation
2. **Test podcast transcription** with your existing OPML data
3. **Review results** and implement any critical fixes
4. **Configure optimal settings** based on performance analysis
5. **Set up regular monitoring** for ongoing validation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All test suites run successfully
- [ ] Transcription speed/quality tradeoffs understood
- [ ] Search quality thresholds established
- [ ] Performance baselines documented
- [ ] Error handling validated
- [ ] Production configuration optimized

## Files to Monitor

- `testing/dashboard/results/` - Test results and reports
- `testing/*/logs/` - Detailed test logs
- `testing/dashboard/test_history.json` - Historical trends
- Performance monitoring outputs

## Integration with Existing Workflow

This testing framework integrates seamlessly with your existing Atlas setup:
- Uses your current configuration files
- Works with your existing OPML data
- Leverages existing output directories
- Compatible with current logging systems

The framework is designed to validate your entire ingestion pipeline and provide actionable insights for optimization.
