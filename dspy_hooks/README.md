# dspy_hooks (Optional)

This folder is reserved for future integration with [dspy](https://github.com/stanford-crfm/dspy) to enable agentic logic in the Atlas pipeline. Example uses may include:

- Routing ingest behavior based on source or metadata
- Wrapping multi-step prompt chains
- Debuggable execution traces during model analysis
- Self-healing steps for failed ingestion

Not used yet, but architecture is open to future upgrade.
