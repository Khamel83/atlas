On paper it looks like you can afford this. Helaine Olen: The subject of debt makes us crazy. We don\u2019t want it. Sallie Mae started calling me, like 10 times a day, they were calling relatives. We\u2019re embarrassed by it. Oh, boy. Do I have to be completely honest? We\u2019re sure if we were somehow better people, we wouldn\u2019t have any of it. I thought I was doing all the right things, and nothing is there. Welcome to this first episode of the United States of Debt, a Slate Academy. I\u2019m Helaine Olen, the voice of the column the Bills here at Slate, and our guide for this series exploring debt in American life. In this first episode, we\u2019ll explore how much debt we have here in the States, and how it piled up. Most of us believe there was a past where we were virtuous, and we didn\u2019t borrow money. We watched every penny. Like my grandmothers, we reused tea bags. We\u2019re sort of correct. That is how a lot of people lived\u2014after the Great Depression. [From the film version of The Grapes of Wrath, 1940] Mae: This here\u2019s a 15-cent loaf Pa: Well could you see your way to cutting off 10 cents worth? Bert: Give him the loaf * * * Franklin Delano Roosevelt: This nation is asking for action and action now. Our greatest primary task is to put people to work. But this virtue was necessity. No one was lending our grandparents money, not the way they lend us money. There were no credit cards. There weren\u2019t even ATMs. If you needed to buy groceries, you went to the bank and withdrew cash. If you fell in love with a dress at the store, and you didn\u2019t have money on you, forget about it! The best you could do was put it away on layaway. When it was all paid off, they let you take it home. Housing was also different, and easier. You saved up 20 percent of the purchase price. You then went to the bank, they interviewed you, they checked your financials. If you passed inspection, you got a mortgage. If not, nothing. Potter: And we\u2019re building him a house worth $5,000. Why? George: Well, I handled that Mr. Potter. You have all the papers there\u2014his salary, insurance\u2014I can personally vouch for his character. Potter: Very good. You see if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. That\u2019s, of course, from the classic movie, It\u2019s a Wonderful Life. And of course, it was a simple, easy to understand, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. And if you wanted a home equity loan\u2014that is, the money you borrow that\u2019s guaranteed by the home itself\u2014they were known as second mortgages. They were embarrassing. No one admitted to this in polite company. And finally, many states limited the interest rates that could be charged on loans. That stopped people from getting into too much trouble. Alright, let\u2019s pause for a second. It wasn\u2019t perfect. A married woman had no right to her own credit \u2019til the mid 1970s. If you were a member of a racial minority, or you lived in the wrong neighborhood, it was almost impossible to get a mortgage, thanks to something called redlining. But the system did, for all its faults, have one big advantage: It was a lot harder to borrow enough money to get into that much trouble. Then, slowly, things changed. American Express commercial: American Express. It\u2019s the only credit card you really need for travel and entertainment. Discover commercial: Free FICO score and credit scores to our card members. Apply today at Discover.com. In the 1960s it changed from a simple charge card that people paid off at the end of the month to something you could carry a revolving balance on. Then student loans came in. And they got a huge boost under President Johnson, who made education a priority. And then, beginning in the 1980s, people were encouraged to look at their homes not just as a simple savings vehicle\u2014they were a cash register, and a quicky one at that. Phil Rizzuto, the famed Yankee, went on as a second career after he retired as a shill for the mortgage industry. And was frequently seen on late-night TV telling people to remove money from their homes. Phil Rizzuto: Qualified homeowners can borrow up to $100,000 and more for any reason at all. Money Store customer: We get our money back guaranteed? Rizzuto: Return the money within two weeks of closing and the deal is off. Real estate home hucksters like Robert Kiyosaki, Carleton Sheets, and Robert G. Allen insisted that real estate investing could be the key to financial independence. Robert G. Allen: Look at the market place! There are more fortunes to be made during these few months than I have ever seen in my lifetime. And I\u2019ve been teaching this for 35 years. Carleton Sheets: I never thought about becoming a millionaire. But I learned one thing very quickly. If you do the right things over and over again, good things happen. And of course, real-estate investing. Robert Kiyosaki: We have cash flow, checks every month. Money flowing in right? Income every month. Which means you can soon quit your job if you want to. And why did people listen to this? Sometimes they were greedy, sometimes they were desperate. Either way, they were earning less than they once were, but their expenses weren\u2019t going down, they were going up. Elizabeth Warren: What these data show is that today\u2019s family with children is going broke over the basics. Elizabeth Warren, before she became a Massachusetts senator, was known for her research on families, incomes, and bankruptcy. Here she is at the Massachusetts School of Law in 2004. Warren: The underlying reality is that today\u2019s two-income family is having to spend so much more just for the core, just for the basics, just for the mortgage and the health insurance and the car and the preschool than parents had to spend a generation ago and that\u2019s what it is that\u2019s driving them into bankruptcy. So in other words, at once you can say, yes, we\u2019ve always understood that having children is expensive, but what\u2019s happened in a single generation is the cost of having children has shot way out of reach of the average median earner. Warren\u2019s research showed, in 1973, families were only using half of their take-home pay for housing, health care, and education. Three decades later? That number was 75 percent. And get this. The 1973 household had only one working adult. Thirty years later, there were almost certainly two. And for many that still wasn\u2019t enough money. So we borrowed it. Robert Lawless is a professor and an expert on debt at the University of Illinois\u2019 law school. Robert Lawless: The increase in consumer credit is part of a larger story about the erosion of public involvement and public support for the necessities and the things that we think people should be able to have. But as we all know, here in the United States, most of us believe we owe too much money. That might be because the amount we owed doubled between 2000 and 2007. Then it, and we, crashed. Newscaster 1: A lot of their customers are freaked out, waiting to see how low the Dow will go. Newscaster 2: They know about gas prices and food prices, do they know about the banking troubles? Newscaster 3: Many of them expressing sadness, shock, also frustration. Newscaster 4: Rethinking of how the American financial system functions. This is a day that will be remembered forever, Sept. 14, 2008. The stock market\u2019s come back since then, and we owe less money. But we still owe plenty of it. Today, the typical household owes about $130,000. Much of that\u2019s for mortgages, but it\u2019s also credit cards and auto loans, student loans, payday loans, and pretty much anyone who will lend money. No wonder people worry that they\u2019ll live with debt forever. There\u2019s something important I need to stress here. While we\u2019re dividing our upcoming episodes into four subjects\u2014credit cards, medical debt, student loan debt, and housing debt\u2014these aren\u2019t four fully separate subjects. Many of us have more than one kind of debt. As you\u2019ll hear from many of the people we speak with in the upcoming episodes, almost all of them have a mix\u2014but it\u2019s not because they\u2019re irresponsible, lazy, or dumb. Leigh: Debt seems to be like a domino effect, and one thing leads to another. Some of it is credit card, student loans\u2014all sorts of things. I had to borrow $8,000 against my 401(k) to pay the bills. My daughter just graduated college last year, so, it wasn\u2019t how we planned it. No. We\u2019ll put it that way. That\u2019s Leigh. What he didn\u2019t tell you? His financial troubles began when he had a heart attack in his early 40s. His finances, and his heart, have never been the same. If people run into financial trouble\u2014for ANY reason\u2014it spills over into other areas of their lives. Carmen Rita Wong: For a lot of folks very simple things happen that can set you back very badly. Let\u2019s say you don\u2019t have an emergency fund, and let\u2019s say you lose work, or someone cuts your hours. Or a child gets sick and you have to basically fill up your deductible on your medical coverage. That\u2019s Carmen Rita Wong, a debt expert who has covered personal finance for CNBC. Wong: You know, $3,000, $6,000 a year, that\u2019s huge money for a lot of people. And it\u2019s really hard to dig out of that. So then they\u2019re paying monthly into this credit card bill, and then that ability to save disappears. But all too often we don\u2019t believe it. We think there\u2019s something they could have, should have done to prevent it, or make it stop. Here\u2019s professor Bob Lawless again: Lawless: We\u2019re hard-wired psychologically to see people\u2014and see where people are as a result of who that person is rather than their circumstances. So we see someone who\u2019s borrowed and say, \u201cThat person\u2019s irresponsible.\u201d We don\u2019t say, \u201cThis person\u2019s lost their job, and she has three kids, and needs to put clothes on their back and food on the table.\u201d No one is perfect. Yes, many of us spend more on vacations and eating out and other luxuries than we should. But it\u2019s rarely the source of our financial woes, or certainly not the full source of them. As I always say, you see people buying a latte, you don\u2019t see them buying their Lipitor. But most people don\u2019t get that. Here\u2019s CNBC\u2019s Rick Santelli. Rick Santelli: This is America! How many of you people want to pay for your neighbor\u2019s mortgage that has an extra bathroom and can\u2019t pay their bills? Raise their hands. He went on an epic, famed rant on air in 2009. The one that started the Tea Party. Santelli: President Obama, are you listening? And then there\u2019s Bible Belt personal finance guru Dave Ramsey. Dave Ramsey: And don\u2019t talk to me about going on vacation. You\u2019re broke! Broke people don\u2019t go on vacation! He\u2019s begged people to shun bankruptcy and pay down their bills despite the fact\u2014get this one folks\u2014he\u2019s declared bankruptcy himself, way back in the 1980s. But now he gets on the radio five days a week to tell people to pay down their bills and not declare bankruptcy. Ramsey: When it comes up inside of you, it changes your life. And then you have to have a clear path to run on, and that starts with the budget, and the excess you squeeze out of the budget from increasing your income and decreasing your outgo, by cutting back on things like not seeing the inside of a restaurant unless you own it or you work there. You lay out the game plan and you get in attack mode. Beans and rice, rice and beans. And then there\u2019s America\u2019s money superstar Suze Orman. Suze Orman: You absolutely know why you choose to get manicures all the time, why you choose to buy a snowboard when you are behind payments on your student loan. Her tough talk got her branded \u201cthe queen of the crisis\u201d by Time magazine. Here she is dishing it out to folks on Oprah: Orman: You are lying to yourself. You are lying so that you can have a justification as to why you bought a $1,400 bed. Why you drive a car. I have gone through every single penny that you spent. These are the most horrible FICO scores I have ever seen. Every time you decide to pay your rent versus your student loan, a bed versus your student loan, eating out versus your student loan. What you are doing to yourself is really committing financial suicide. If you take this sort of stuff seriously, know that four years later, Orman appeared in a commercial for a $40,000 Acura TL. Orman: That\u2019s not a dress, that\u2019s an emotional money mistake. Listen, I don\u2019t have anything against luxury, I like luxury. But you have to be reasonable. OK, spend smart! Acura TL voice over: This holiday, listen to the voice of reason \u2026 * * * Joseph Cohen: America is a place where the luxuries are cheap, and the necessities are expensive. That\u2019s Joseph Cohen, a professor of sociology at Queens College at the City University of New York. Cohen: That\u2019s a quote from an audience member at a presentation that I gave years ago. It was in response to some research that I did that looked at where Americans had been spending their money. He thinks we obsess about small self-indulgent spending while ignoring the big picture. Cohen: We think of those small treats that we give ourselves and we think well, I really didn\u2019t need that and I could have saved $5 here and $5 there. But the truth is that all those small treats are small when it comes to their dollar impact on the budget. The real drivers of household spending, there\u2019s three big areas: education, health care, and housing. But, of course, you\u2019ll see this all play out over the next four episodes, where we meet a variety of people who\u2019ve had to deal with burden of debt. She had her debt, I had mine, things were getting tight. And as you know, when finances are tight, then it\u2019s not a very happy house. You know, maybe $50 over here and then $50 over there. And then, little do you know, it\u2019s, like, gone. Debt is not a problem when things are good. But debt is a horrible thing to have when things are bad.
