Is AI just better software? Or something completely different that requires a new paradigm to understand? Today we sit down with Bret Taylor and Clay Bavor, two of the best product builders in the world to tackle that question. Bret and Clay are the co-founders of the AI company Sierra. Brett's resume reads like a greatest hits of Silicon Valley: co-creator of Google Maps, founder of FriendFeed (acquired by Facebook where he became CTO), founder of Quip (acquired by Salesforce where he became co-CEO), former Chairman of the Board at Twitter, and current Chairman of the Board at OpenAI. Clay spent 18+ years at Google, starting as an APM alongside Brett and eventually running product for Gmail, Drive, Docs (all of Google Workspace), Google Labs, and the company's AR/VR efforts. In addition to AI, today\u2019s conversation has some great tech industry history discussion and old Google stories, perfect to tide us all over between Google Part I and Part II!

Cloudflare provides networking services for websites in the cloud, and has one of the most effective and fascinating freemium business models in tech . In this interview we discuss Prince\u2019s background, the original Cloudflare idea, and what Cloudflare is today \u2014\u00a0and the opportunistic way in which it became the company that it is. Prince\u2019s latest focus is the economics of Internet content sites; he is very worried about the impact of AI on the traditional traffic business model that Google created, and is using Cloudflare\u2019s power to try and create a new business model for content. We discuss Prince\u2019s motivations and concerns, and why Prince believes this is a legitimate use of Cloudflare\u2019s power, even if the ultimate decision-maker about the future of the web is Google.

On to the Interview: An Interview with Cloudflare Founder and CEO Matthew Prince About Internet History and Pay-per-crawl This interview is lightly edited for content and clarity. Topics: Background | The Cloudflare Idea | Cloudflare Today | Cloudflare\u2019s Niche | Pay-per-crawl | Cloudflare\u2019s Power | The Google Problem | Cloudflare\u2019s Motivation Background Matthew Prince, welcome back to Stratechery. Matthew Prince: Thanks, Ben. You\u2019re actually one of the earliest Stratechery interview subjects. In fact, I\u2019ve talked to you twice. In both instances, however, the interviews were very focused , primarily on content moderation issues. This was also before I released my recordings of the interview, the modern Stratechery Interview format. To that end, that means I have an opening to still do my regular question for a first-time interview subject: I\u2019ve never asked you your background like how did you get started, how you became interested in tech, take me back to the beginning. MP: I grew up in the mountains of Utah and when I was six years old \u2014 I actually used to think it was seven but my mother corrected me \u2014 when I was six years old in 1980, my grandmother for Christmas gave me an Apple II Plus and I took to it just like a duck to water. The University of Utah has a really actually world-class computer science department, and my mom used to take continuing education classes there and she would sneak me in basically as her precocious kid and she\u2019d pretend to do the work but I\u2019d really do all the homework. Oh, she was actually registered for classes and you were just tagging along? MP: That\u2019s right. And I did things that made you really popular in high school, I went to computer camp, there was a computer camp, we had Cate, the boarding school out in Santa Barbara and I wish I\u2019d stayed in touch with those people because I bet the people who were there with me have gone on to do pretty amazing things. And I went to college thinking I was going to study computer science and then having the hubris of an 18-year-old, I took Computer Science 105 or whatever it was and was bored out of my mind because I\u2019ve been doing this for quite some time. I actually transferred my major to study instead English Literature which is a different direction, but I still knew a lot about computers. I started college in 1992, it\u2019s right as the Internet is taking off and they needed students who had some understanding. I was one of the student network administrators and that\u2019s how I learned how switches and routers and everything worked. I had a fiber optic line straight from my dorm room back to the university\u2019s router, had faster Internet for those first few years than I did for many years since. Oh, yeah. At Wisconsin people generally, I\u2019ve said this before, but people usually only stay in the dorms one year, and me and some of my friends stayed in two years just because that was where you got faster Internet. But we didn\u2019t have fiber optic lines, they were T2s or something like that. MP: Yeah, and that was that. I had offers at the end of college to go do a job that honestly I had no idea what it was but it was a product manager, which I was like, \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d. I think it\u2019s 2025 and no one still knows what it means. MP: And are having to reinvent themselves again. But I think that I had offers at Microsoft and Yahoo and Netscape and I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to do that\u201d, and instead I\u2019ll go to law school, and so I actually went to law school and thought I was going to be a lawyer for a while. And probably but for the dot-com bust, I probably would be. That\u2019s not the answer you would expect, you would think, \u201cThe dot-com bust drove me out of tech\u201d, how does the dot-com bust drive you out of law and into tech? That seems backwards. MP: Well, it kind of drove me into tech a little bit. I had found the type of law that I enjoyed was securities law, which is basically taking companies public and so the summer of 1999, I worked in San Francisco as an intern at a large law firm, we took six companies public over the one summer and it was amazing, it was so much fun. And my plan was go and work for the law firm for a while and then find a company that I thought was really great and help them in financing or whatever. Yeah, be their GC or something. MP: And I\u2019d eventually go in-house, and that was what I thought my journey was going to be. Then the dot-com bust happened in March of 2000 and the law firm called up and said, \u201cHey, good news, bad news. Good news, you still have a job. Bad news, we don\u2019t need any more securities lawyers. But bankruptcy law is basically the same thing and we think you can handle it\u201d. And again, as a lawyer I\u2019m like, \u201cIt kind of is the same thing\u201d. A lot less fun. MP: There\u2019s no in-house left after the company has gone bankrupt. So there\u2019s a guy named Doug Lichtman who\u2019s a young law professor who would always come over to my apartment and we\u2019d share a bottle of wine and he\u2019s like, \u201cMy brother is starting a B2B company in the insurance space and they\u2019re looking for someone with your skill set, would you be interested?\u201d, and I was like, \u201cYeah, that sounds amazing\u201d, and maybe they\u2019d match your salary and they\u2019ll give you this thing called stock. I was like, \u201cYeah, sure\u201d, and so I did that and we raised about $6 million. It was the same business model as almost like Rippling today but it was way before its time. And we were idiots and we blew it up in every possible way and so we blew through $6 million over the course of about 18 months and it was a colossal failure, but it was just incredible to see that a group of people could come together with an idea on a piece of paper, try to build something, fail, fail honorably. Again, I think it just wasn\u2019t the right time and then no one went to jail, which was pretty amazing. We lost all this money from the investors and the investors were like, \u201cYeah, that sucks, if you guys start something new, let us know\u201d, and I was like, \u201cWow, this is some sort of magical world I didn\u2019t know existed\u201d. So I then spent the next eight years trying to find my way back to that, although largely wandered in the wilderness. I was a bartender, I taught LSAT test prep, I did a bunch of just odd jobs just to make ends meet. This is when you started Unspam , right? MP: Yeah. And you wrote a paper about the CAN-SPAM Act , I think you were teaching a law course about that. What got you interested in spam of all things? MP: I thought it was an interesting legal question. It is with a very few exceptions, until the Internet comes along, there aren\u2019t a lot of ways to be sitting in one place and commit a crime on the opposite side of the earth. There were some, you could do postal fraud and a couple of things, but all of a sudden that became a real thing that was happening at real scale. And then secondly, it was the first time that you could be sitting in one place of the world, send an email to another place, potentially commit a crime and not even know you were doing it because you don\u2019t have any sort of jurisdiction which is attached to it and so I thought that the question of how you were going to apply jurisdictional laws to things like cyberspace was a really interesting question. Again, I was playing law professor largely, I was an adjunct which was the lowest tier of professor at a law school that doesn\u2019t exist anymore, that\u2019s how bad it was. (laughing) Was this University of Chicago Illinois or\u2026? MP: It\u2019s not the University of Chicago, University of Chicago is terrific, it was John Marshall Law School in Chicago, which does not exist anymore. But it gave me an excuse to think about and write about things and I had a thing that was today we call blog but it was before that term had been even coined. I think the same way that you get to write and talk about things that you\u2019re interested in, that was a period of my life that I got to do that. My parents were deeply worried that I would never make anything of myself and I honestly was a little bit worried about the same thing, but I think it was actually really important for just having the perspective to then go on and start Cloudflare. What was was Unspam specifically though? MP: Unspam initially started out as being a cool domain that I had registered and I was like, \u201cWhat can I do with this?\u201d, and the first thing we tried to do is disposable email addresses, the same thing Apple does now where you can basically have an email address and then if people start sending you stuff you don\u2019t want, you turn the email address off and it goes away. I started doing this in college in the 1990s where I still have this domain that I use for all these email addresses, it turns out it\u2019s actually a very difficult way to live. MP: (laughing) I have that same problem. There are so many assumptions built into having a common email address across different places that it\u2019s actually pretty tough. I\u2019m stuck with it now! MP: Yes. Well, we should commiserate over this at some point because I have the same problem. And also just explaining to someone and you\u2019re talking to the customer service agent at Nordstrom, and they\u2019re like, \u201cOkay, what\u2019s your email?\u201d, and I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, it\u2019s nordstrom\u2026\u201d Nordstrom@domain.com. MP: And they\u2019re like, \u201cNo, no, no. What\u2019s your email?\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cWait, do you work for us?\u201d MP: And then, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d So yes, I\u2019ve had many of those. That\u2019s where we started. We then got the Do Not Call list was coming along so the question was, \u201cCould you build something like the Do Not Call list but for email?\u201d, and so we ended up being strangely a government contractor where we worked with various states. Originally, we started out actually with Chuck Schumer and the CAN-SPAM Act but the federal government never implemented it. But Michigan and Utah and a couple of other states implemented this thing that basically said if you put your email on a list, then they would maintain the list and then what we did was we just provided hashing technology where we\u2019d hash the marketer\u2019s list, we\u2019d hash the government\u2019s list, and we\u2019d compare the two. So neither side knew what was on the others list and it wasn\u2019t world-changing technology but the company is still around, it\u2019s profitable but it was never going to be a really, really big business. You have an undergraduate degree in English, you go to law school, and then you decide, \u201cOh, I need to get an MBA as well\u201d, you go to HBS. Did you have an idea that you want \u2014 was that a, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with my life so I\u2019m going to go to Harvard?\u201d \u2014 which is a lot of people do things like that. Was it a, \u201cI specifically want to gain some sort of knowledge, I want to start a business?\u201d, what\u2019s the sequence of events here given that Cloudflare the idea started there in Cambridge? MP: I started Unspam and Unspam was floundering along and not doing very well. And my dad \u2014 we\u2019d grown up upper-middle class and my dad owned a bunch of restaurants \u2014 not good restaurants \u2014 like Applebee\u2019s, Famous Dave\u2019s Bar-B-Que, he had the only Hooters in Utah. An adventure in its own right. MP: Yeah, and he was in his late 60s and he called me up and he said, \u201cSon, I\u2019ve taken care of you a lot of your life and it\u2019s time for you to come run the family business\u201d, and I couldn\u2019t imagine anything worse than running my dad\u2019s Hooters. So the idea of going to business school was, I was on my second bottle of wine trying to figure out, \u201cHow the hell am I going to get out of this?\u201d, because it was a good business and someone needed to run it and I thought, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll apply to business school\u201d. I applied to eight business schools, the night the applications were due, I ended up getting rejected from seven of them and then somehow got into HBS and called my dad and said, \u201cHey\u2026\u201d. \u201cI really want to do it but I need to go get some training first!\u201d MP: \u201cI really wanted to do it but I need two years to try and do this business thing, I think I should understand accounting a little bit better\u201d, and he was like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a really good idea, you should do that\u201d. So I went off and I had a Voice-over-IP phone that I was in the dorms, this tiny little dorm in Alston, in Cambridge, and I plugged my Voice-over-IP line in so I still was working for Unspam, the phone rang, I\u2019d pick it up, and then I was doing business school stuff. I was much older than the usual business student and I taught law, which it was like this total unlock where I was like, \u201cOh my gosh, everyone does grad school wrong and especially business school wrong\u201d. How so? MP: They think that the goal of the class is to think of the clever thing that no one has ever thought of before, which leads you down a bad path. Whereas really the goal if you\u2019re faculty is to take students on a Socratic journey to make a point, and you start at point A and end in point B and you can figure out what that arc is. So the way that I approached business school was I would just say \u2014 whenever someone would have some crazy point, I just try and get us back on the arc, and that made me every faculty member\u2019s closest friend. Especially with the Harvard teaching style with the cases and things like that where they\u2019re trying to guide a discussion, it\u2019s not necessarily a lecture, I can see that appealing for sure. MP: Yeah. It was funny, in almost every class because they\u2019d get descriptions of who the students were, the faculty about three lectures in would come up to me and they\u2019d say, \u201cSo you used to teach law school?\u201d, and I was like, \u201cYeah\u201d, and they\u2019d say, \u201cNothing like a lawyer to ruin a good conversation\u201d, and I said, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s true\u201d, he said, \u201cHere\u2019s the deal. I won\u2019t embarrass you if you don\u2019t embarrass me\u201d, and I said, \u201cDeal\u201d. So business school at that point became just a lot of fun and I did pretty well at it. But mostly I was spending that time just trying to figure out what can I figure out to do that won\u2019t have me go back and run my dad\u2019s Hooters? The Cloudflare Idea Where did the Cloudflare idea come from? Was that directly downstream from the Unspam work? You can certainly see the links there. What\u2019s the connection to Clayton Christensen and disruption? You\u2019ve talked about that in retrospect but it\u2019s one of those things when you look backwards, you can paint this picture of I learned about disruption, I wanted to start this company that served an underserved market. Is that how it worked or what was the actual progression? MP: These things all start with people. There were two people who were critically important, one was an employee at Unspam, this guy named Lee Holloway who we\u2019d hired straight out of college and was just \u2014 there are some people that are just real technical geniuses, and Lee was this incredible technical genius and we built the core technology for Unspam but we also had all these side projects. One of those side projects was a thing called Project Honey Pot which actually built \u2014 Paul Graham , the Y Combinator guy, before Paul did Y Combinator, he would host a conference at MIT called the MIT Anti-Spam Conference, and he invited me out one year to give a talk on how to write laws to throw spammers in jail, that went over pretty well. He\u2019s like, \u201cCome back, just do the same talk\u201d, I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not going to do the same talk, I\u2019m the lawyer, I\u2019m not going to do the same talk to a bunch of technologists, they were polite the first time\u201d, and he\u2019s like, \u201cOh, you\u2019ll come up with something\u201d. So I went back to Lee and I was like, \u201cCould we build a system to track how basically bad guys steal your email address?\u201d, that turned into something called Project Honey Pot . Gave the talk, it was wildly popular, put it in the corner, and over the course of the next few years, over 100,000 people signed up for this service. And Lee was there, Lee at the time, while I\u2019d gone off to business school, he continued to do technical work at Unspam. But it was not the highest, most interesting technical work, and he had called me and said, \u201cHey, you\u2019ve always been really good to me but\u2026\u201d, and at that point in the conversation, I was like, \u201cStop right there, give me some time, I\u2019ll figure something out\u201d. Because Lee was one of those people you just wanted to have on your team, he had offers at Google and Facebook and that. On the other side, a lot of people in business school are obnoxious, but there was this one woman who was really just genuinely trying to find the right answer and had no vanity about the whole thing, and that was Michelle [Zatlyn] . Michelle was clearly the opposite of me, and I\u2019m not the most organized person, I\u2019m not the most disciplined, I\u2019m not about process. Michelle was a Six Sigma Black Belt and she\u2019s just all of those things and with Unspam, I had started with two other friends and we fought like crazy and so I was really trying to look for people that had real difference from who I was, and Michelle was just this all of the things that I was bad at, she was amazing at. So I was always pitching her on various ideas. Most of my ideas were \u2014 they were really, in retrospect, terrible ideas. But one of them I was telling her about Project Honey Pot, and she was just perplexed by the thing. She was like, \u201cWhy do people sign up for this?\u201d, and I was like, \u201cBecause we track the bad guys\u201d, and she\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, but it takes effort, do you give them anything?\u201d, and we\u2019re like, \u201cWell, they get recognition for what they\u2019ve done\u201d, she\u2019s like, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense, why would anyone do this?\u201d. And I, frustrated at an Ethiopian restaurant in Central Square in Cambridge, I said, \u201cMichelle, someday they want us to stop them\u201d, and she said, \u201cThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s the idea, let\u2019s build that\u201d. And literally that night I called Lee and I pitched, \u201cHey, here\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work, we\u2019re going to do it this way\u201d, and I spent 30 minutes just walking him through the entire idea that Michelle and I had sketched out. At the end of it, he stopped for about five minutes, to the point I thought the line had gone dead, and at the end of it he was like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019ll work, let\u2019s do that\u201d, and that was the start. So it was Lee, Michelle and I were the original three co-founders of the company, it started as a school project. The original idea was, \u201cCould you take a firewall and put it in the cloud?\u201d, so Cloudflare is us playing with firewall in the cloud. And for at least the first five years, what we kind of outlined over the course of the next few days turned out to be a almost perfect roadmap for what happened over the next five years. So you have this service that is super beneficial for tiny websites, you can sign up for Cloudflare for free to protect you from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. It has this really virtuous cycle where ISPs are grateful that you exist because you consume a lot of bad traffic, that they\u2019re happy to have you on board, this gives you a better service. It\u2019s really the growth story, which I\u2019ve written about , is really compelling and interesting. And as you\u2019ve articulated, there is this disruption angle where you\u2019re approaching the problem from a completely different approach of say, a public cloud or certainly on-premise software. You couldn\u2019t be more different than that. Is this a thing where you had the agreements with your professors? You\u2019re not going to make a fool out of them. So did you walk in to Professor Christensen and be like, \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019ve already done this\u201d, or what is the connection there? MP: I was taking, I have to remember, I think I had just finished Clay\u2019s course when we started working on Cloudflare so it was coming really fresh out of that and Clay and I had, I think, a really very strong relationship and I just loved the course and got to take it from him. Early on, I think that it gave us the confidence. We knew it\u2019s really hard to build businesses unless they\u2019re consumer, but even then it\u2019s really hard, but it\u2019s really hard to build big businesses in a B2B space on 20 bucks a month fees. There\u2019s a reason everyone ends up getting sales forces and selling to big companies. MP: That\u2019s right. So we knew the only way it would work is if we got to the point where we\u2019re selling for tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, which we do today, to big enterprises. But the question is how do you get from here to there? I think because of the nature that we had to build this network out because we needed data and because I\u2019d come out of Clay\u2019s class, I think that all gave us the confidence to say, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to start focusing on how do we provide a service for free that\u2019ll be stripped down and limited in a bunch of ways, but make it better than anything else that\u2019s out there and then continue to move up market\u201d. And at some point, we would cross the point where the features that we had would be more than what people could get from the alternatives, which were companies like Akamai and the on-premise hardware folks. Then the hyperscalers were sort of emerging at that point and that\u2019s exactly what happened. It\u2019s interesting today because at some level we just had the belief that if enough of the Internet flowed through us, we\u2019d find some way to make a business around it and we really did believe in the mission of helping build a better Internet and I think those two things together have allowed us to have the success and get the scale that we have today. Is it ironic or maybe intentional that this sort of boutique interest you had in crimes being committed across the world, no longer limited by geography, basically you need some sort of push to get people into your business and so the criminals were actually your most important, they were your salespeople, they created the market for you? MP: Yeah, we\u2019ve never thought about it that way, and there have been various times that there have been hackers who have been like, \u201cI\u2019m reformed, I want to get a job\u201d, and we\u2019ve been like, \u201cYeah, not so sure\u201d. But I think that the Internet is a complicated place. Early on people would say, \u201cWho\u2019s your competition?\u201d, and I said, \u201cFacebook\u201d, and I actually still believe that\u2019s really true. I think had Cloudflare not come to exist, much more of the Internet would\u2019ve existed on Facebook because it was becoming too difficult as a small website owner to put up with the hassle of it and so people were racing behind the walled gardens that were out there. What we tried to do is say, \u201cHey, let\u2019s give you still the freedom to innovate, but help you have the kind of protection that you don\u2019t have to worry about all of the nasty things that are out there\u201d, and so I think in the same way that Amazon is to Shopify, Facebook is to Cloudflare. Not a perfect analogy, but I think we try to be the minimum amount and then let just any type of creativity or uniqueness happen behind the scenes, whereas the walled gardens are a different thing. Cloudflare Today What is Cloudflare today and how would you contrast that to the idea 10, 15 years ago? And is this a path that is about the path you expected to walk down with some obviously diverges along the way, or have you ended up in a different spot than you expected? MP: I think the real story of Cloudflare is that we wanted to put a firewall in the cloud, and we knew that in order to sell to JP Morgan and governments and big hospital groups and things like that, we had to start small and work our way up, so we made the service free. What we didn\u2019t expect was the number of problems that that would create. All the world humanitarian organizations were sort of our first customers because they had big security problems and small budgets, and so they all signed up and then people would try and DDoS attack them or hack them in various ways. Not ideal customers. MP: Well, again, in some way, perfectly ideal customers because we learned a ton, but then we would stop them. But then all the hacker kids are like, \u201cWow, these guys are pretty good, I\u2019m going to sign up because all my friends are trying to hack me\u201d. So then all the hackers are on us, but then the hackers try and push us in every possible way. So why did we build a domain name registrar ? It\u2019s a terrible business, it is a commodity, why would we do it? Because we looked at everybody else and no one else was secure, and we came this close for cloudflare.com getting hacked, and that would\u2019ve been a disaster. So we were like, \u201cThe only way we can solve this is to bring it in-house\u201d. Why did we build our VPN replacement series of products ? Because we looked at all of the other folks that were in the space and we\u2019re like, these guys, they just can\u2019t deal with the scale and complexity of everything that we have, so we\u2019ve just got to go build it ourselves. Why did we build a developer platform ? It wasn\u2019t because we thought we were going to sell it, we built it, we needed it ourselves, we needed a sandbox environment so we could build things. Now, all of those things turned into substantial kind of product lines for us. But really Cloudflare is the story of we create a series of problems and then we solve them ourselves, and in the process that turns into products. I would\u2019ve never imagined \u2014 the very first meeting we had with venture capital, this guy named Ray Rothrock who was the first money into Cloudflare, and we pitched him and he says, \u201cGreat, I only have one question\u201d, and we\u2019re like, \u201cOkay, what?\u201d, he\u2019s like, \u201cWhat are you going to do about the death threats?\u201d, and I was like, \u201cDeath threats?\u201d, and Michelle was like, \u201cWhat are you even talking about?\u201d. (laughing) The uncertainty that the black belt six sigma does not want in their life. MP: And he\u2019s like, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do this, you\u2019re going to piss a whole bunch of people off\u201d, and so I would\u2019ve never imagined that I\u2019d be personally sanctioned by the Russian government and supposedly on some Putin kill list, that wasn\u2019t what I was signing up for and so I think that we have done something which is very different. I think because of the fact that we\u2019ve made it available so broadly, we end up touching a bunch of content, that then means from time to time \u2014 although it\u2019s interesting, you said the two times we\u2019ve talked before were all about content moderation. I was going to ask you, is the topic dead? It doesn\u2019t seem to come up much anymore. MP: Well, so we\u2019re 15 years old in September. We\u2019ve had three major incidents of this where there\u2019s stuff that\u2019s illegal, we take down all the time, but for the kind of stuff that\u2019s immoral but not illegal, there\u2019s this sort of gray line that\u2019s there, three incidents over 15 years. So the mean time to incident is five years, we\u2019re due for another one. There\u2019s going to be something, I don\u2019t know what it will be. But inherently, if you sit behind enough of the Internet \u2014 right now, we\u2019re being sued in Italy, Spain, a bunch of other places and it is largely because people who own football teams, soccer teams, they don\u2019t like people illegally streaming their content. We don\u2019t like people illegally streaming their content, it burns through a bunch of bandwidth. We try and shut it down, but they\u2019re very clever, so they find different ways to do it. So we\u2019re in these fights where we\u2019re kind of like, we\u2019re trying to not have this happen, and so I think that the nature of what we do is going to always have some controversy that\u2019s around it. But frankly, that\u2019s kind of what makes it so interesting as well because we do find ourselves in the middle of some really interesting policy debates. I do want to come back to that in a little bit, but one thing that I think defines Cloudflare, and this is always interesting, you have these product weeks where you have 47 announcements, it\u2019s hard to parse them all. What I like about companies that do that, this was like Nvidia back in the day, they knew they had something with GPUs and CUDA and they would throw so much spaghetti against the wall, every single GTC, they\u2019d have it twice a year and people would ask me, \u201cHow do they do this?\u201d, I\u2019m like , \u201cWell, because it\u2019s all the same platform, it\u2019s just everything is sort of software defined, so they\u2019re actually just releasing these libraries that are marginally different from each other, but they can frame them as being different things\u201d. That\u2019s sort of like Cloudflare, you have this common architecture on commodity hardware. Was that very purposeful from the beginning or is that a similar function of, \u201cWe\u2019re a scrappy little startup putting a server in an ISP, we can\u2019t afford anything more than a Pentium or whatever it might be\u201d, and it turns out that actually ended up being the way to build out infrastructure? MP: Yeah, I think we were really inspired by the Google story of, if you think of who was the leading search engine before Google launched? It was AltaVista. And who built AltaVista? Digital Equipment Corporation. What was Digital Equipment Corporation\u2019s business? They sold mainframes. Why did they launch a search engine? It was a demo on how powerful their mainframes were. And so then Larry [Page] and Sergey [Brin] come around as Stanford students, and the key innovation of Google isn\u2019t actually search, it\u2019s their ability to store and process data much more efficiently than anyone else, being cheaper and faster than anyone else, and that they could scale the mainframe to be infinitely large effectively and they did it by just taking a bunch of commodity hardware. We, from the beginning I think, I was firmly in this camp, Lee was firmly in this camp. There\u2019s some people on our team who were not firmly in this camp, and so there were fights early on about whether we should have specialized hardware to do various functions, or we should take commodity hardware and then write the clever software to do scheduling and everything else that you needed. Again, that\u2019s one of those debates. We were eight people above a nail salon in Palo Alto, and it could have gone either way. If it had gone a different direction, we wouldn\u2019t be the company we are today. Today still, almost every server that makes up Cloudflare, is one of a different generation. I think we\u2019re on generation 13 now and we\u2019ll buy the servers in bulk. The servers now have five major components. So they\u2019ve got network, CPU, GPU now, long-term storage and then short-term storage, so SSDs and then RAM. We\u2019re constantly asking ourselves, and this is where a lot of innovation, there\u2019s a once a quarter meeting that our infrastructure team and our product team have that they call a hot and cold meeting and they ask the question everyone asks, which is, \u201cWhere are we running hot?\u201d, and then the question is, \u201cCan we do engineering to make that more efficient or do we have to deploy more hardware in those places?\u201d. But they ask the equally important question of, \u201cWhere are we running cold?\u201d, and that I think is the more interesting thing, which is, \u201cWhere are those opportunities where we\u2019ve already paid for a resource, it exists in the wild, but it\u2019s not being utilized enough, what can we go build on that resource?\u201d. My somewhat distasteful maybe analogy to this is if somebody came up with the idea of selling the advertising space above urinals in bathrooms and bars, I can tell someone thought of doing that, it wasn\u2019t worth anything, the minute someone did it, you\u2019re all of a sudden generating a new stream of revenue from that. Cloudflare is asking that question all the time, which is, \u201cWhere is that kind of extra space, extra capacity?\u201d, and then if we can sell that, then we have higher margins and it allows us to continue to do all the things we do. What\u2019s the split then of business that\u2019s opportunistic versus very intentional and you\u2019re pointing to it for a long time? MP: We are not the place where we come up with hundred page business cases. I mean, again, we built Cloudflare Workers because we needed it and now it\u2019s the fastest growing part of our business. Cloudflare\u2019s Niche You\u2019ve talked about being a fourth cloud in the past, I wrote about that , I feel like I haven\u2019t heard as much about it as late. Did the public clouds respond faster to that than you expected, whether it be Lambda and things like that or what? MP: I think what\u2019s happened is that we\u2019ve each carved out our lanes and while we compete at the margins, we are very distinct in those lanes. The analogy is, I think that companies have personalities just like employees that do various jobs functions have. The hyperscalers, so AWS, Google, Microsoft Azure, their job function personality is the DBA, the database administrator. And if you\u2019ve ever worked with DBAs, they are brilliant, but they\u2019re oftentimes kind of rigid. They see the database as the center of the world, the entire thing they\u2019re doing is all the data has to be in the database. To be fair, the database is kind of the center of the world, in their defense. MP: It can be. Again, that is one way you are showing your colors, I guess. The other version, which is more us, is the network administrators. It\u2019s funny you mentioned that, actually for the business of Stratechery and Passport, the stuff that I work on, I think a lot about databases. It\u2019s actually really important! MP: I think a lot about networks, you think a lot about databases. But the functions of those two things are actually really, they\u2019re not diametrically opposed, but there\u2019s tension between them, because the purpose of the database is to hold onto the data and store it no matter what. The purpose of the network is to move the data and get it off your system as fast as you possibly can and those are two very different things. So if you\u2019re really good at databases, you\u2019re probably not going to be really good at networks and if you\u2019re really good at networks, you\u2019re probably not going to be really good at databases, and I think that\u2019s true. I think that the networking products of the hyperscalers kind of suck because they don\u2019t actually want data to leave and our database products, honestly, aren\u2019t as good as the hyperscaler products. Again, they have certain advantages, there are times when you want to use them and you don\u2019t want to use theirs, but they\u2019re definitely tertiary to what it is that we are doing as a business. I think that a bad outcome in the future for Cloudflare is one where the world becomes more unicloud where everyone says, \u201cI am a hundred percent all in on AWS\u201d, in that case, there\u2019s not a lot for us to do. A good outcome for Cloudflare in the future is a world where you are more multi-cloud, in which case then the network becomes the things that rationalizes between the different cloud providers. Is this the area where AI has actually been positive for you? Not so much in building AI products, but in the fact that it\u2019s given a motivation for companies to be more multi-cloud? MP: Yeah, I think that\u2019s true. And I think also, yeah, and you\u2019ve got big data sets that you have to move around in ways, we\u2019re really good at that. There\u2019s just a lot of things where for one reason or another \u2014 if you\u2019re building an agent today, probably Cloudflare Workers is the best place to build it. You can spin it up, you can spin it down, it can connect all around. It\u2019s got to pass through us anyway because we\u2019re such a large portion of the Internet and so that has been, I think that actually the sort of AI and AI agents has been the killer app for Cloudflare Workers, but it\u2019s less about how \u2014 we\u2019re never going to be the right place to run SAP HANA , but we\u2019re definitely the right place to run the agents that have to interact with the rest of and move around the Internet. Pay-per-crawl The reason to talk now, and we\u2019ve talked offline about this a few times, both this year and last year, is your push for this pay-per-crawl concept . Why don\u2019t you give me the high level overview, the pitch from your perspective, which I think has evolved? I would like to think partially based on some of my feedback, but what\u2019s the pitch in September 2025? MP: Let\u2019s take Cloudflare out for a second and just talk about\u2014 Talk about Matthew, the English student? The student newspaper editor. MP: This is me channeling inner law professor. Let me give you the history of the Internet and why the Internet exists the way that it does and what\u2019s changing. This is usually my job, but go ahead. MP: And you can tell me where I\u2019m wrong, but this is my quick history of the Internet, and apologies to Michelle who hates history lessons. For the last 25 years, the interface of the Internet has been search, and Google has dominated that space, and Google, their incentives as a company were to have the Internet grow as much as possible because if you have chaos, then the search becomes the organizer of the chaos. But you need incentives for people to actually create content and so Google not only had to create the thing that organized the Internet, but they then had to take the thing that took the traffic of where people went and then helped people monetize that, largely through advertising, although they also helped with subscriptions, and Google was the great patron of the Internet for the last 25 years. The web would not exist the way it does if there were not something like Google out there to create the incentives around. There were a lot of problems with incentivizing around traffic, we created systems where people would just literally try and create rage-baity headlines to get people to click on things so that they could put ads against them and so not perfect, but we don\u2019t have the Internet that we have today unless we have Google and search funding that. That is changing. The world is shifting where the interface of the web is shifting from search engines and search engines give you a treasure map and say, \u201cHey, go figure out what your answer is by clicking on these 10 blue links\u201d, to what are effectively answer engines. So if you look at OpenAI, if you look at Anthropic, if you look at Perplexity, even if you look at modern Google, they are not a search engine, they don\u2019t give you a treasure map. Instead, they give you an answer right at the top of that page. That answer, for most users, 95% of the users, 95% of the time, it\u2019s a better user interface. I\u2019m not anti-answer engines, I\u2019m not anti-AI, I think it\u2019s better in every possible way for that to be what the interface is that we all interact with. But the problem is that if you get the answer and you don\u2019t get a treasure map, then you don\u2019t generate traffic and if you don\u2019t generate traffic, then the entire business model of the web, which has been based on traffic starts to break down and you can see that, not so much in e-commerce sites, not so much in things that actually sell you the physical thing because if you asked what\u2019s the best camera to buy, even if you get an answer, you\u2019ve still got to go buy it from somewhere. It\u2019s going to take the e-commerce and the people who are selling things that\u2019s going to work but the person who wrote the review\u2014 The great thing about physical products is by definition they are scarce and the problem with text on the Internet is it is not scarce. MP: It\u2019s not scarce, that\u2019s exactly right, and Google set this expectation that everybody can scrape the Internet for free, but it was never free. The Internet has never been free. Google paid for it for a really long time and the quid pro quo with the content creators was, \u201cWe get a copy of your content and in exchange we\u2019ll send you traffic and help you monetize that traffic\u201d. That quid pro quo breaks down as we shift from search engines to answer engines and so something is going to change. I see three possible outcomes for that. And again, none of this involves \u2014 if Cloudflare disappeared tomorrow, this is still happening, one of these three things will happen. One, all of the journalists, academics, and researchers in the world will starve to death and die. And it\u2019s crazy, like when you post this stuff on Twitter, how many people were like, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t really need journalists anymore, we have drones\u201d, and I\u2019m like, \u201cI think we still need journalists\u201d. This is the point that I make a lot because people will hold up Stratechery as a model for journalism in the future, and subscriptions and the whole small scale subscription model. I\u2019m very proud of Stratechery\u2019s role in figuring that out, but I\u2019ve always said, look, my Articles are generally completely fresh content, but my Updates, how do I always open them? By quoting from a journalist like, \u201cOkay, now I\u2019m going to analyze this piece of news that someone actually collected\u201d, so I\u2019m with you on that point. MP: And how would you know what to write about, you\u2019re derivative of those things. That\u2019s great, and I think that adds an enormous value, and I think as you\u2019ve said in the past, there will still be tentpole content that\u2019s out there that people will have to have. But there\u2019s a whole bunch of other stuff like what happened in the world that somebody has to report on, and again, there is a real risk that if the business model completely dies, that that goes away, and I think that would be a loss. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be the outcome. Don\u2019t you think that that\u2019s already happened to a certain extent though? People worry, complain about there\u2019s lots of national coverage, but say on a local basis, the local newspapers being decimated by the Internet and don\u2019t make any money, don\u2019t have reporters, who knows the City Hall is doing, et cetera. MP: I think that that\u2019s the Google model of paying for traffic doesn\u2019t support local media in the same way. My wife and I bought the local newspaper in our hometown, it actually turns out to be a pretty good little business, surprisingly. I\u2019m a big advocate . I think that local news actually could be. MP: Well, I think it\u2019s going to become massively more valuable and so we\u2019ll get to that. The second possible outcome \u2014 Sorry, you didn\u2019t make the agreement that you made with your professors, you had to tell me to let you cook and not keep interrupting you and being a pain. Sorry, continue. MP: No, it\u2019s fine. Sorry, continue. MP: It\u2019s your newsletter and show. Continue, continue. MP: I\u2019m just the entertainment! The second option is that \u2014 and I don\u2019t think this is outlandish, but I think it is a Black Mirror option, which is that, can you imagine Sam Altman announces tomorrow he\u2019s standing up his own version of the Associated Press? Yes, I can. MP: See what I\u2019m saying, can you imagine he announces he\u2019s bought Gartner? It\u2019s not insane. It could be that we don\u2019t go back to a media time of the 1900s, we go back to a media time of the 1400s, and it\u2019s like the Medici\u2019s, you\u2019ve got five powerful families that control and pay for all of the different content creation which is out there, in which case it is likely that there\u2019s a conservative one, there\u2019s a liberal one, there\u2019s a Chinese one, there will be an Indian one. The Europeans will try to build one and then it won\u2019t work, and they\u2019ll use the liberal US one and that could very well be what happens with content. I think that that\u2019s not inconceivable, and it\u2019s not actually that many far degrees away from what Scale AI was doing where you\u2019re sorting and organizing content for people and tokenizing it. There are a lot of unemployed journalists, it\u2019s not that expensive to stand up a bunch of bureaus, but I think that\u2019s a really dangerous outcome because it\u2019s incredibly regressive where the Internet was this great leveler, this great distributor of knowledge. If all of a sudden we\u2019re all spending thousands of dollars a year on whichever AI system, even the wealthy will probably pick one, and if the knowledge that you get all comes from that one, all of a sudden we\u2019ve siloed things again and that seems really, really risky, but not totally inconceivable. What\u2019s number three? MP: Number three is we figure out a new business model, and it has to be some version of the revenue that is generated by the AI companies, the answer engines that are out there, some portion of it goes back to the content creators. And how that works again, I think is what we\u2019re trying to figure out. But I think that there are really three things today that you need to be an AI company. You need access to GPUs and OpenAI spends over $10 billion a year on that, but it\u2019s silicon and like all silicon over time it will become more and more of a commodity, it just will because there\u2019s never been a silicon shortage that hasn\u2019t turned into a silicon glut. Everyone in the world is racing to compete with Nvidia, Nvidia might stay in the lead for a really long time, but you\u2019re going to have AMD and Qualcomm and Apple and all the hyperscalers come up with new things. We just need to keep Taiwan intact. MP: We do need to keep Taiwan intact. And you moving, you were the front line of defense as far as I heard. Family reasons\u2026 MP: The only thing that kept the Chinese away was Ben. The second thing is talent \u2014 today we have an enormous shortage because frankly, if you were getting a PhD in AI five years ago, you were a laughingstock. It was a dead space. Today it\u2019s the hottest space, everyone\u2019s turning up a new thing and so we\u2019re going to go probably not from a shortage to a glut, but you\u2019re certainly not \u2014 the days of a billion dollars to come work at Meta if you\u2019re a great AI researcher, those days are limited and it\u2019s not going to be that way forever. We\u2019re going to have a lot more people who are flocking to this because education markets and employment markets are efficient. The third thing that you need is content. And again, we have this expectation because of Google, that content should be available to all the robots for free, but that\u2019s not sustainable. You end up in either everyone dies of hunger or we live in the time of the Medicis in those models, so in some way we\u2019ve got to figure out a new quid pro quo. You could think about it as $1 per monthly active user per year for any of the AI companies goes into a pool that then gets distributed to content creators. If you do the math, that\u2019s about $10 billion today in terms of content, that would entirely replace all of the ad revenue that is generated by the non-walled garden Internet today, so take Instagram and Facebook and TikTok and those- Like the Google networks, TradeDesk, etc. MP: But include the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, the FT, Reddit, everything else, it\u2019s about $10 billion a year. That\u2019s a lot of money, but that\u2019s not a crazy amount of money. And if we can figure that out, we can actually then create a better business model, which if we do it right, I think it actually encourages better media and better content to be created at the same time. You talked about earlier the question of getting from here to there, which is certainly the question that applies here. There\u2019s also the issue of what we want to happen versus fighting economics and the fact that text is infinitely replicable and can be spread and you put years into worrying about spam, spam is still a problem. MP: Sort of. Not the problem it used to be. Honestly, if you\u2019re \u2014 I remember when Bill Gates was like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to solve spam in the next five years\u201d, and I was like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not, this is an intractable problem\u201d. Actually, they largely did. It all comes out on the backs of people like me just trying to send an honest newsletter to people\u2019s inboxes. MP: It makes it harder for you, yes. When you think about this and what you can do, how do you separate the, \u201cOkay, this is what I want to happen\u201d, versus, \u201cThis is what is possible to happen and there are actually levers that I can pull to make it happen\u201d? MP: I think the first thing is that all markets require scarcity, you can\u2019t have a market if you don\u2019t have scarcity, there has to be some scarcity that exists in that market. But that\u2019s the problem with the Internet is 45% of the people might decide to buy into this concept, but then the 55% just run the table. MP: Potentially, but if they don\u2019t have access to the content, then it becomes harder. And so what we\u2019ve just seen is that for content creators that are out there, especially if they create scarcity, they actually are able then to do deals. So you look at Reddit. Reddit has been very aggressive at stopping bots from scraping their content, including Google. They said, \u201cGoogle, you don\u2019t get access to this unless you pay for it\u201d, and as a result Google and OpenAI struck a deal with Reddit where they pay \u2014 we know from their public filings that this isn\u2019t anything that is confidential \u2014 but in 2024 they got $120 million for 2024 and I\u2019m told that the deal in 2025 was even better. I think that you\u2019ll see that going up. What I think is actually really interesting is if you count up the number of tokens in Reddit and the number of tokens in the total catalog of The New York Times, it turns out about the same within an order of magnitude, and yet Reddit got seven times as much. The question is why? And I think answer is because The New York Times \u2014 you might love The New York Times, but the difference between The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the FT, the Washington Post, and the Boston Globe from the perspective of an LLM is actually not that much. The facts are the facts are the facts. And so yes, there\u2019s some color and there\u2019s different slants, and the opinion pages might be slightly different, but it\u2019s kind of the same. So I actually think the thing that\u2019s really encouraging is we already see that where scarcity exists and where content is unique, like if you don\u2019t have Reddit, you don\u2019t have Reddit, so you need to have that content. I think that if we can create scarcity in these cases, what the market will show is that it\u2019s actually that local, unique, differentiated content, which is the most valuable and as this market for content exists and comes on to being, again, regardless of Cloudflare, if Cloudflare disappears, I still think that it is inevitable that publishers will say, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to shut down the access of the bots to have access to our stuff, and then we\u2019re going to create a market for the most unique stuff\u201d. And the more unique it is, the more you\u2019ll get paid for it, I think that that\u2019s just inevitable. I think that this is one of those seminal moments where we\u2019re shifting the business model of the web and I\u2019m actually super encouraged that the future of content is going to be much more like early Internet than, and again, with all due respect to my friend Ben Smith, BuzzFeed. Cloudflare\u2019s Power If it\u2019s inevitable though, then why does Cloudflare need to be so aggressive? You\u2019re instituting these policies of doing your best to block bots, putting together protocols for recognizing what it\u2019s worth, payments, etc., all very nascent to be sure, a lot to be figured out. But you are not taking the posture of a company that this is inevitable and it\u2019s going to be great, you are being pretty forceful in trying to make something happen. MP: Well, I think if we weren\u2019t doing it, someone else would. But what I think we have a unique ability to do is we\u2019re really good at stopping things like bots because we do it every day. So again, it wasn\u2019t like we were sitting around being like, \u201cHey, what should we do next? Let\u2019s go change the business model of the web\u201d, it was our customers who were publishers were coming to us being like, \u201cWe\u2019re dying and we don\u2019t have the technical wherewithal to step in front of it, but we need to stop this, please help\u201d. And honestly, when Neil [Vogel] at Dotdash Meredith was telling me this, I rolled my eyes and I was like, \u201cPublishers, they\u2019re such Luddites, they\u2019re always complaining about the new technology, they\u2019re always complaining about the next thing, this isn\u2019t a big deal\u201d. And Neil and a bunch of others finally said, \u201cJust go pull the data\u201d, and it was only when we actually saw the data, when we saw that over the course of the last 10 years, it\u2019s become 10 times harder to get a click from Google for the same amount of content on that same kind of basis, it\u2019s now 750 times harder with OpenAI, it\u2019s 30,000 times harder with Anthropic. The business of traffic on the Internet as being the currency is going away and so something either again, either content creation is going to die, it\u2019s going to become futile, or we\u2019ve got to create a new business model. Again, if our mission is to help build a better Internet, this seems squarely in the line with what we should be working on. So why does Garry Tan say that you are an axis of evil with Browserbase and you should legalize AI agents? MP: I really don\u2019t understand. I mean, I\u2019m confused by Garry, I think part of it might be that he\u2019s an investor in Perplexity. Every story needs four characters, you need to have a victim, you need to have a villain, you need to have a hero, and you need to have the village idiot or the stooge. And if you think about it, any news story has those four characters. Right now, the people who have most been the villains have been Perplexity , where they\u2019re doing just actively nefarious things in order to try and get around content company. I\u2019ll give you an example of something that we\u2019ve seen them do, which is that if they\u2019re blocked from getting the content of an article, they\u2019ll actually, they\u2019ll query against services like Trade Desk, which is an ad serving service and Trade Desk will provide them the headline of the article and they\u2019ll provide them a rough description of what the article is about. They will take those two things and they will then make up the content of the article and publish it as if it was fact for, \u201cThis was published by this author at this time\u201d. So you can imagine if Perplexity couldn\u2019t get to Stratechery content, they would say, \u201cOh, Ben Thompson wrote about this\u201d, and then they would just make something up about it and they put your name along it. Forget copyright, that\u2019s fraud, just straight up and that\u2019s the sort of bad behavior of some tech companies that again, I think needs to be called out and punished. The Google Problem You go back to 2024 though, so I think, I don\u2019t remember if it was you or someone else calling out Perplexity for ignoring do not crawl things on websites, and people got really up in arms about it. My pushback at the time was , \u201cDo we want Google competition or not?\u201d, because what Google is doing is yes, OpenAI pioneered their own web bot and protocol and you can ask OpenAI to not crawl your website and they respect it. Google did the same, but the Google same one is Googlebot-extended, the actual Googlebot is like, \u201cWell, you want to be in search\u201d, and it turns out AI Overviews is governed by Googlebot. So why does Google get to do it and Perplexity can\u2019t? MP: I think we should have an open bet, and I\u2019ll take whatever bet you want. It can be a basketball game at some point. It can be whatever is is, that 12 months from now, will Google provide publishers a way of opting out of AI Overviews? And I\u2019ll say yes, and I think you\u2019ll say no. I don\u2019t know, I have to think about this, I\u2019m not committed, I\u2019m not committing yet. MP: Okay. But I agree, and you wrote about it, is Google is the problem. We were very careful when we did this. We actually blocked training, which is what they use Gemini for and so we can block that and we\u2019ve blocked that across the place. We have not blocked RAG, we\u2019ve not blocked search for anyone including Perplexity, even though they are doing naughty, naughty things. And by the way, OpenAI is evidence that you can do the right thing, you can be good actors and you can still have actually a better product as a result, and be a viable competitor to Google. So I think that Google will, and I am hopeful that they will, because they are a company that has really believed in the ecosystem, and they see what\u2019s happening in the ecosystem and they understand that if something doesn\u2019t change, that the ecosystem is going to suffer. I think that they will voluntarily give publishers a way out of AI Overviews within the next 12 months. I\u2019m actually optimistic it will happen faster than that and if they don\u2019t do it voluntarily, I know that there are a number of regulators that would be happy to force them to do it. Do you feel encouraged or discouraged by the Google case this week ? MP: Well, so first of all, it\u2019s like 280 pages long. It was really long, I was up until 5:00 AM, I had to read through the whole thing. MP: I\u2019ve read summaries and I\u2019ve had my team who are going through it. So I\u2019m not sure that forcing them to sell Chrome is the right remedy. No, I thought that it was dumb. I think the big thing is, my whole thing with Google is they\u2019ve basically paid off everyone , and then the justification for allowing them to continue payments is that everyone\u2019s dependent on Google payments. It\u2019s like this circular justification, which isn\u2019t wrong, but that\u2019s basically the nut of it. MP: Again, I\u2019m not an expert on the \u2014 as we\u2019re recording this, that came out yesterday, and so I\u2019m not an expert on it yet \u2014 the thing that worries me the most is that some of what the judge suggested was that Google had to share data with the rest of the ecosystem, and so a horrible outcome for this that will actually destroy the ecosystem, and the most depressing sentence in the ruling that I\u2019ve seen so far was the one that was like, \u201cIt seems like this might have bad impacts on the publishing industry, but not a single publisher testified\u201d, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh guys, you got to get on the field if you\u2019re going to win the game\u201d. So I do think that regardless of what Cloudflare is doing, the economics of the Internet are changing, they\u2019re changing because there is a better interface that is coming along that is being provided by a lot of people including Google and if the ecosystem is going to thrive and survive, we have to change the economics of the compensation to content creators. We can do that in a way which I think is very reasonable, and my prediction will be that over time, AI companies will look more like YouTube or Netflix, where they compete on what original content they have access to as opposed to the algorithms. We already see the algorithms are largely commodities, they\u2019re leapfrogging each other all the time, I think that\u2019s going to continue for quite some time. I am in the there will be thousands of different AI interfaces we\u2019ll pay for or they\u2019ll be ad supported in various ways, but what will cause you to choose one versus the other is whether or not they have access to whatever it is that you particularly care about. I do think, by the way, I think I agree with your bet just because the core Google strategy that paid off massively in this case is basically paying everyone off. MP: That\u2019s right. So that\u2019s why this is a scheme to pay everyone off. MP: Exactly. Now I think it\u2019s really important \u2014 so again, I don\u2019t know exactly what this is \u2014 but we have to make sure that whatever the payment scheme is that it takes into account that if you\u2019re smaller, you pay less, and if you\u2019re bigger, you pay more. So again, my straw man on this is $1 per year per MAU, and you pay it into a pool and then how we distribute it out to the content creators, that\u2019s a whole other can of worms. Potentially a very profitable can of worms if someone can sit in the middle and be the market maker. MP: Potentially. Could that be Cloudflare? MP: Whether we\u2019re that or not, again, if it\u2019s profitable, there\u2019ll be a lot of people that will be competing to do that and if we can add value, then we\u2019ll capture some of the value. But I think that the most important thing is how do we figure out some way where the vast majority of that is actually going to the people that are doing the work of creating content? And ideally, do it in a way where what we\u2019re rewarding is not who is rage baiting people, but who is actually filling in human knowledge. Cloudflare\u2019s Motivation I wrote this a few months ago , you know we\u2019re on the same page, it\u2019s just what\u2019s striking about you doing this is like, well, maybe someone has to actually break some eggs to make it happen. MP: Of course. But this leads to my final question that ties together when we talked about content moderation and now we\u2019re talking about this, is there a dichotomy between the power you\u2019re seeking to leverage to push through this new standard for content, and then the power you claim to not want when it comes to content moderation? \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be involved\u201d, well, do you want to have power or do you not? MP: We still want to stop when cyber attacks are coming. That\u2019s where we built a fairly valuable business in having the power of doing that. I think where we get nervous is in saying, is this content good or bad? And so for instance, I think that the right way to figure out who gets paid as content providers is not Cloudflare coming up with an algorithm that says, \u201cThis is important content, you should have it and this is unimportant content, you shouldn\u2019t\u201d. Each AI company should come up with their own algorithm and be able to plug it into, whether it\u2019s our system or our competitors, whoever it is, and say, \u201cHere\u2019s our system, you see content, rank it for us based on our algorithm and OpenAI\u2019s rank will be different than Anthropic\u2019s, will be different than Perplexity\u2019s\u201d. You should have that ability and that ranking should I think be scored on two different axis, which is how reputable is this, and then how novel is it? How much does it actually further that? If you do that correctly and you have a real variety of different \u2014 if you have tons of different AI companies and you have tons of different content creators, then again, I think sure, we\u2019re playing the role of being the technical facilitator there, but the actual decisions on what content matters and doesn\u2019t, that still is something that, again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right place for us to be making those decisions. You want to be a market maker, not a picker. MP: We\u2019re not an editor. That\u2019s the word. MP: Yeah. Again, I think the one thing that we are very good at right now is creating scarcity and every market depends on that. Whether we or someone else then figures out how to monetize that scarcity, it\u2019s fine and by the way, I think the vast majority of this will be large publishers doing direct deals with large AI companies. But that sucks for all the small guys. MP: That\u2019s where again, we can be kind of a piece of it where we say, \u201cOkay, we now on behalf of the small guys, let\u2019s work with you to figure out how you can participate in this market as well\u201d. Small guys on both sides \u2014 small AI companies, startups. We have to make sure that as we design this, that it\u2019s working in this way, and then small content creators. I guess my ask would be, since you have a relatively influential list, if you\u2019re an academic and you\u2019re reading Ben\u2019s stuff and you think that this is really interesting, the reason Google ended up figuring this out, and I think being a great force of good in the world, Google did a lot of good in the world. The reason they did that is they thought very carefully about how these market dynamics are and so we\u2019re trying to work with the leading academic economists and market theoricians to figure out, \u201cHow should this market look like going forward?\u201d, and so reach out if you\u2019re reading this because we\u2019d love to talk to you about it. We spent a lot of time at the beginning \u2014 we\u2019ve gone a little long, I appreciate you sticking on \u2014 talking about your background and how you got to where you were, it\u2019s really interesting. It\u2019s not the traditional tech path, is that actually integral to this final topic? If you are just a traditional, came up through computers, went to Stanford, started a company, would you be picking this fight, or is this downstream from teaching out of law school that doesn\u2019t even exist anymore, just to get away from Hooters? MP: Just to get away from running my dad\u2019s Hooters. I don\u2019t know. I think that the most valuable \u2014 so I have an English major, I have a computer science minor, I\u2019ve got a law degree, I\u2019ve got a business school degree, there were lots of times where I thought those three years at law school where completely wasted. It is incredibly valuable. I can sit and read the Google judge\u2019s ruling and understand what\u2019s important and what\u2019s not in that, those things have been incredibly important. I think that the ability to speak and write and communicate and appreciate how much work creating great content is, I think that that\u2019s been really helpful. I think I\u2019ve tried, when we\u2019ve talked about content moderation in the past, we struggle with those issues and struggle with what the right thing to do is. It went back to what side of the bed did you wake up on, right? MP: Yeah, totally. (laughing) That\u2019s a reference for people that don\u2019t remember previous controversies. MP: How angry your girlfriend at the time, wife now, is at you at that particular moment. But going back and literally reading Aristotle, I think that that\u2019s great. And so today I get invited, there\u2019s a handful of AI companies that have invited me to be on their board and things, and I always say no. But I talk to them and I must be one of the top non-academic buyers of Aristotle\u2019s Politics , because almost every AI CEO has gotten a signed copy from me saying, \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is incredibly important, but you\u2019ve got to think about the ethics and how to create trust\u201d. I do think that, I hope that the people that are building these incredible systems that are going to be incredibly transformative, that they do spend some time in the liberal arts, that they do spend some time actually stopping and reading and thinking about like, \u201cOkay, if we\u2019re successful\u201d \u2014 I think there\u2019s been a lot of, \u201cIf we\u2019re successful, it\u2019s some version of James Cameron and Terminator\u201d. But I think there\u2019s another version which is, \u201cOkay, if we build these powerful systems, how do we make sure that they\u2019re trustworthy over time?\u201d, and those are issues that people have struggled with for a long time and I feel very lucky to have gotten the time to sit and think about them and I do think that that\u2019s been helpful and instructive to the company that Cloudflare is today. Well, I feel happy and lucky to have had your time in this interview. Thanks for coming on. MP: Ben, thanks for having me. This Daily Update Interview is also available as a podcast.

Jerod: 00:36 Now, onto the show. Daniel: 00:49 Welcome to another episode of the Practical AI Podcast. This is Daniel Witenack. I am CEO at Prediction Guard, and I am joined as always by my cohost, Chris Benson, who is a principal AI research engineer at Lockheed Martin. How are doing, Chris? Chris: 01:04 Hey. Doing great today, Daniel. How's it going with you? Daniel: 01:07 It's going great. I traveled a bit over the weekend to run a mini marathon, which was fun, but I am back safe at home. And, of course, safety is is something that hopefully we can talk a little bit about today with our with our guests who are, Rick Kobayashi, who is cofounder and CEO at Citadel AI, and Kenny Song, who is cofounder and CTO at Citadel AI. Welcome. Kenny: 01:34 Thank you for having us. Rick: 01:35 Yeah. Thank you, Hwal. Daniel: 01:36 Yeah. It's great to have you both here. Good to get introduced to you both. I'm I'm really excited about this conversation because, of course, security and safety related to AI is very close to my own work, so it's always great to connect with people in this space. Yeah, I'm also interested to hear a little bit, and I even saw some things on your website, you know, talking a little bit about some of the AI in Japan, some of the, I guess, regulations or guidelines for for businesses that have come out there. Daniel: 02:12 So maybe before we get into the nature of what you're building and what you're doing, any thoughts for those out there that might be in The US or in Europe and be constantly exposed to the things that are going on in AI in those jurisdictions, Any thoughts about what is the same or what stands out about what's happening with AI in Japan? Rick: 02:37 So, yeah, anyway, thank you very much for joining us. My name is Rick. And as for the Japanese conditions, basically, I'm afraid to say it's around one, two years behind The US situation, basically, up to now. But on the other hand, surprisingly, as for Gen AI, I think that Japan is one of the most advanced countries. Not the development of the foundation models, the utilization of the Gen AI applications. Rick: 03:11 And probably it might be related to kind of Japanese animation or cartoon. So, you know, like there are lots of say robot or some of the say animations which specify some of the AI or robot technologies and, you know, Doraemon or there are lots of animation over there. And people are very getting familiar with such a kind of talking with robot or some of these advanced computers from the childhood. So in that sense, I think that many people do not have any hesitation to work with or talk with like a chatbot or any GenAI. So in that sense, the hurdle to introduce LNM or GenAI in Japan is very low in that compared with US or other countries. Rick: 04:02 So in essence, development side or technology side, frankly speaking, Japan is behind The US situation. But as for the usage of such kind of a generic, I think, I hope Japan is one of the most advanced countries. Daniel: 04:17 Yeah. That's really interesting to hear the sort of perception side of things. And of course with more, maybe even more adoption or adoption that's ahead of maybe other places in the world, it could be that users or usage of the technology has hit some bumps along the road or has hit some problems, which I know is a lot of what you all are working on. What has been the situation in Japan around regulation and business usage of AI? Is it on the more regulated side or less regulated side in terms of government and, I guess, regulation in terms of security or safety, privacy, these sorts of things? Rick: 05:13 I think Japan is in the middle between EU and The US situation. So they say that it's a soft approach. So there is no strict regulation in Japan, but there are lots of kind of guidance in Japan. And people have already noticed some of the issues on the security side or safety side of AI. And on top of that, they are trying to introduce LLM applications for contact center applications. Rick: 05:47 So they are concerned about more reputational risks rather than security risks. So in essence, they understood the importance of the safety of the AI or trustworthy of the AI, but more concerned about reputational risks rather than security risks. Chris: 06:08 I'm curious as we're kind of talking about the adoption and the environment around that, as you kind of mentioned that in Japan, it's very you know, people are really getting into the utilization of LLMs and generative AI. Do you have any any kind of thoughts around, you know, what is it what is it that's driving that, you know, compared to other countries that you've observed? If you're looking at that kind of adoption in Japan versus The US or versus Europe or whatever. Any thoughts around that? Because I I had I had observed that as as someone in The US that Japan seemed to be implementing, and I was kinda curious if there was you know, what was the what was kind of the driving force there that that got the utilization up, especially among just your typical average everyday folks there, not outside of the AI industry? Chris: 07:00 I would love your thoughts about that. Rick: 07:01 I'm not so sure the the background reasons why Japan is more aggressive to introduce such a kind of L and M applications. Probably as I said, people have lower, say, risk of perception, I must say. In some cases, in Japan, like a chatbot or kind of, say, new technology might be a kind of friend in a sense. Sure. In US side, such a kind of a new AI is kind of enemy of a human. Chris: 07:33 Yeah. So they're kind of a a little bit of a cultural difference in terms of how that that openness to adoption and stuff. So, yeah, that would make sense. That would make sense to me. Daniel: 07:43 Yeah. And I guess sometimes your your friends can potentially hurt you even if they even if they're not not trying, which I know, you you all are are kind of involved in both, you know, the evaluation of these systems, you know, running metrics against these systems and kind of building trust, in in a very real way. Kenny, I'm wondering if we bring you in here and and maybe just, you know, safety and security around AI is such a broad topic now with so many people addressing it from so many different perspectives. I'm wondering if you could help us zero in on maybe the kinds of problems that you all are exploring and how those fit kind of more generally into the landscape of, I guess, security risks or threats as related to AI. Kenny: 08:36 Definitely. Yeah. So thank you for having us on the podcast. My name is Kenny. I'm the co founder and CTO of Citadel So what we do at Citadel is we build software tools to help organizations test, monitor and govern their AI systems. Kenny: 08:52 And in the world of LLMs, when customers come to us, they usually have some proof of concept that they've been developing internally. They've been using some foundation model, they're building some chatbot or some agentic workflow, and they come to us when they want to make that proof of concept production ready. Usually their main problem is they want to mitigate some of the risks that they see. Things like hallucinations, toxicity, or users trying to prompt inject the system. They're looking for a solution to these types of problems. Kenny: 09:27 That's where we come in as a tool provider. Daniel: 09:30 Yeah, and how does that, I guess, how are you seeing when you're interacting with your customers or they're coming to you with these problems? What is the impact of those problems like hallucination or injection? Is that something that is causing real problems or something that they've sort of heard about that they're concerned about, but it's maybe not causing real problem? What are you seeing there in terms of, I guess, the impact? Let's say I just want to throw caution to the wind and ignore these things. Daniel: 10:03 What's the bad side of this that could happen were I to take that more loose approach? Any thoughts? Kenny: 10:13 Yeah, I think it's usually a mix of both. It also depends on the risk appetite of the company that's developing the system. And typically, our customers are larger enterprise companies, both inside of Japan and outside of Japan. And so they have very mature risk management practices. And before they, you know, launch these POCs into a production service, whether that's internal facing or external facing, they want to make sure that they, you know, have appropriate controls in place to manage the risk and they've properly identified the potential risks, reputational data security, so on. Kenny: 10:54 So yeah, I think for the customers we talk to, it's generally a big concern for them. And they come to us with the problem of mitigating some of these risks that they've already identified. Chris: 11:07 I'm curious, as you've kind of identified, you know, what that kind of the strata of customers that you're looking at there, What what is kind of is there is there something that definitively kind of separates that kind of mature larger organization from some of the smaller ones? Do they have a different set of problems that they're coping with or maybe just haven't gotten far enough along in terms of maturity on risk management? What like, at what point do you see the uptake kind of falling off within maybe smaller organizations? You know, what's what does that look like as you as you move from that upper strata into the mid tier? Kenny: 11:48 I think my my general perspective is that there's two ends of the spectrum of like startups to enterprise company. And for startups, the risk is fairly low because you don't have a brand to protect, you don't have an existing business to think about. You can just launch these POCs out to your customers very quickly and you can iterate quickly. For enterprise customers, they tend to be more guarded. They have a closer eye on potential risks to the business. Kenny: 12:20 Those are the customers that really want pretty robust testing before deployment, and also monitoring and potentially real time guardrails filtering after deployment. I think it depends a bit on the size of the company. Daniel: 12:35 I'm wondering with that, as you're looking to those types I'm curious a little bit of the backstory of Citadel. Maybe Rick, you could tell us a little bit of kind of how you came to these problems because you seem like you have customers now, you've developed some of these things. When did that happen? How early was that in kind of Was that before GenAI? Was that as GenAI was coming up? Daniel: 13:05 How did things develop in terms of your thinking around these problems and how you would bring something to the market in terms of addressing them? Rick: 13:14 So in that sense, was before Gen AI. And actually, the person who came up with such a kind of idea is not me, but Kenny. So Kenny has worked in Google brains, and he was one of the core member of the TensorFlow team. So he's taking a leadership to develop the most advanced AI technologies in Google and found that there should be a lots of risk about the trustworthiness or safety of the AI. And he believes that probably he is the best person to explain by himself. Rick: 13:50 But anyway, he reached the idea that some of the tools which protect sort of kind of safety or security issues should become popular, especially in the enterprise companies where they may not have a bunch of AI engineers inside. So that is a background. Our company name Citadel itself is shown what we are focusing. So Citadel is, as you know, saying like a vault or castle. So we are the company to say, protect such a kind of risk, human from AI risks. Rick: 14:29 Such kind of a concept is say, based on our company name. Daniel: 14:35 Yeah, anything to add there, Kenny? Kenny: 14:37 Yeah, that's a pretty good overview of the background. When we started the company, it was at the 2020. So it was before the era of large language models. And We were initially really focused on helping organizations monitor their traditional predictive AI models, so tabular models, vision models, that kind of thing. About two years ago, we started getting a lot more interest from our customers in LLMs. Kenny: 15:04 And how do we reliably test this new technology? How do we integrate it into our workflows and our business applications? And so these days, I think a lot of our new customers come to us with LLM types of questions. And then we still have a lot of existing customers that work more on the predictive AI side. Chris: 15:25 So Kenny, I'd like to follow-up as you guys were kind of developing the idea going back to that a moment for the company. And Rick mentioned that you had been there at Google Brain and that you were on the TensorFlow team. I'm I'm curious how as a you know, for me as as a someone who's used TensorFlow a bit. And so that was like, wow, you know, one of the people who helped put that together. I'm curious what parts of the experiences you had there led into the formation of Citadel in your mind is, as you had some of the the insights that you might have developed in your previous employment. Chris: 16:05 Did did any of that what you know, how how did that lead to what Citadel does? How did that kind of bring forward when you and Rick started the company up? Kenny: 16:14 Sure. So a bit more about my personal background. So in 2017 to 2020, I was working at Google Brain as a product manager. And my team was responsible for building machine learning infrastructure at Google. This included TensorFlow and also other platforms like TFX, TensorFlow Extended, and some of the work on Google Cloud's AI platforms and so on. Kenny: 16:39 So sort of the software foundations that power a lot of Google's machine learning applications. Think Google tends to be pretty ahead of the curve in AI adoption. Think back then it was more called machine learning rather than AI. But basically what we worked on was making models at Google more reliable at Google production scale. That usually meant building these pretty sophisticated pipelines that not only target training the models, but also serving them in production. Kenny: 17:12 We had pretty robust systems for monitoring data drift and validating data that enters production models, monitors the output of these models. And, you know, at Google, you can afford to have hundreds of platform engineers build out this kind of infrastructure to use internally. But for most other types of organizations, they can't make that level of investment in internal platforms. And we felt that there was an opportunity to sort of build some of these model monitoring and data validation tools for other companies. And so that's where the idea of Citadel AI kind of started. Kenny: 17:49 And when we started the company originally, we focused a lot on adversarial attacks, actually back in 2020, since it was a very hot research topic. Basically, designing noise and images and other types of input data to trick models into making the wrong predictions. We found that after a few months, this wasn't really a problem that companies were interested in. It's a very interesting research problem, but less interesting commercially. After that, we pivoted towards more observability and testing of these predictive models. Kenny: 18:25 These days we focus a lot more on LLM testing and monitoring. Daniel: 18:29 Maybe you could just give us, going back to you, Rick, maybe you could just give us a few examples that stand out of kinds of companies and the kinds of models that they're running and the way that or some of the things that they would be interested in tracking or detecting or observing. A few concrete examples might help our audience kind of grasp some of the cases that you're working with. Rick: 18:56 One of the largest customers in Japan is the financial industry, surprisingly. Like banks or insurance companies or security companies are very aggressive to introduce LLM applications into their core operations, such as like a contact center or internal applications. And when they say they can go through POC stage and when they get into commercial operations, they start caring about some of the kind of safety issues. So because those financial industry is governed by the government itself. So in essence, different from regulation related AI, they have already been kind of regulated by traditional, say financial regulations. Rick: 19:53 So if say LM applications behave badly, that damage their core businesses. So to introduce such a kind of AI application is to differentiate or advance their services compared with their competitors. But by introducing new technologies, if their core business is damaged, that would be very, say, huge negative impact. And also, if AI behave badly, as I said, the Japanese government may say, in some cases, call or punish them. So that is one of the most largest risks for them to introduce L and M generic applications. Rick: 20:44 So what we are doing is to making sure that such kind of a bad behavior will not happen in the application or not, and making sure that they can safely introduce Sego into commercial operation. So some of the leading the bank company or insurance company is our say our customers. Chris: 21:05 Gotcha. I'm curious if I could follow-up on that for a second. We've kind of talked about the the notion of risk management in general that that industry is is dealing with. How do they given the risks for a large, you know, organization to implement LLMs? Do you do you have any insight into how they're making the the risk management judgment on the benefits of implementing maybe a new chatbot versus the potential downside where, you know, as you pointed out, could be damaged to brand, damage to core operations, damage from a regulatory standpoint. Chris: 21:42 That's as I'm listening to you, that does sound very risky, you know, from that perspective. How do they make how do they evaluate that? Like, say that they know that they wanna come to Citadel and get that help. What do you have a sense from your customers what a typical balance on that is of the benefit of the LLM utilization versus the downside if things go off? How do they what are they thinking when they come to you in that way? Rick: 22:07 So in that sense, they fully understand that balancing is very important. So to protect the risk so much may say delay the service advancement. On the other hand, say, without having any security or safety test, they may get into bad situation. So they need to know how to balance such a kind of risks and benefit. And they have set up several, like, internal organization to manage such a kind of risk insight. Rick: 22:44 So, yeah, as you can easily imagine, financial industries they are very structured company. So there are some of like risk management department inside. And in some cases, are like AI governance team inside or something like that. So they jointly work together and try to manage such a kind of a risk. And at the same time, they try to introduce the advanced system so that they can differentiate themselves from others. Rick: 23:16 And it's true as for the contact center, probably the same situation in The US. But when the consumer end user try to reach out the banks or insurance company and call it free dial, In many cases, they can't easily reach to the contact center person. They have to wait thirty minutes or something like that. So because of that situation, they are so aggressive introduce such kind of applications into contact center and internal purposes. Daniel: 23:51 And I'm just thinking about this scenario where you have the contact center, you're introducing whatever it is, a chatbot, a voice assistant, that sort of thing. Then I'm thinking back, to what Kenny was talking about kind of how the company started evaluating models that were not GenAI models yet. I'm wondering, Kenny, if you could help us think about you know, what needs because if I'm understanding, you know, part of what you all are doing, part of it is evaluating the risks of a particular model or system, and part of it is observing those and monitoring those in real time. And if I think about a traditional model, let's say a model that detects tumors in medical imagery, right? I can have a very nice sort of ground truth dataset and Maybe it's hard to get because there's some privacy concerns, but I can still get it. Daniel: 24:50 I need to get it to train my model. I have very specific metrics around whatever it is, accuracy, F1 score, etcetera, can sort of grasp what the performance of that model is, maybe even compare it to human performance. With something like a call center, in some ways people might struggle to connect that to real metrics that make sense, right? Because it's like, Oh, well, people could say anything to the chatbot. How do I know, one, what's going to come in either from a normal usage or malicious usage or whatever, and how do I connect that to any sort of metric around a model? Daniel: 25:34 I think sometimes people struggle with this idea of metrics and Gen AI models or Gen AI systems. Could you help maybe clarify, what are some of the relevant metrics that people could think about in terms of these systems that might help them understand how the systems are behaving? Kenny: 25:55 Sure. Yeah, that's a very spot on question. I guess before I talk about specific metrics, I'll just take a step back first. If we sort of think at a high level, what is the same between predictive AI and generative AI? I think the structure of how you maintain reliability is basically the same, right? Kenny: 26:14 You need testing before deployment, and you need monitoring after deployment. And it's also very similar to like traditional software applications, right, where you have automated tests and automated monitoring. And so I think that part is the same. But the part that's much trickier for generative AI is that usually, as you mentioned, you don't have ground truth in the same way that you do for a classification data set, for example. And so the metrics that you use for evaluation are not as well defined. Kenny: 26:45 So you can't measure accuracy, you can't measure position or recall. And the output of a generative AI model is also much more complex than just like a probability score. And so in that environment, it's very hard to determine how do we actually evaluate these things in a quantitative and objective way. So the approach that most of our customers take and most of the industry has gone in is basically using LLM as a judge. So you can craft these evaluation prompts that ask an LLM to evaluate some quality of some generated text. Kenny: 27:25 So it could be, you know, a very simple example is sentiment. So you evaluate the sentiment of, of some text, you could do that with traditional, like a sentiment classifier as well. But there are more sophisticated metrics such as, you know, detecting hallucinations against some ground truth document, or measuring the relevance of the answer relative to the question. Or you might have more, we call them custom metrics that are designed to be domain specific. So if you have like a refund chatbot, you can design a metric that measures if the chatbot adheres to your company's refund policy. Kenny: 28:08 And so these metrics, they're very flexible, because you can design the evaluation prompt in natural language. In our tools and our open source libraries, we have a set of built in metrics. It's like a library of metrics you can choose from. But for many of our customers, they also extend those built in metrics to customize them to fit their business applications. Daniel: 28:30 So Kenny, you were mentioning this sort of idea of LM as a judge, which is using a model to evaluate the model in some sort of axis of performance or some quality, which definitely seems like a flexible option. But also some people might be thrown off by this sort of circular using a model to evaluate a model. Also, there's sort of this you then have a model that's evaluating the model, so how do you evaluate the model that evaluates the model? You kind of get in this. How have you all navigated that side of things, both in terms of using the larger model, making sure that the evaluations are sound and also transferable, one model to the other, and maybe benchmarking the system over time? Daniel: 29:29 Because also the models you might want to use as evaluators might change over time. Kenny: 29:34 Yeah, also a very good question. It's a question that we get from our customers quite a lot as well. And the way that we generally approach the evaluation workflow, which includes designing these metrics is not usually human judgment and taste is treated as the gold standard. But the problem with having humans evaluate every experiment with your LLM system is that it's very expensive and it's very slow. In the ideal world, you would design these LLM as a judge metrics that can mimic human preferences. Kenny: 30:08 And so in our software tooling, this is what we design specific workflows to help users to do. Usually when they when a customer starts on a valuation project, they'll, you know, of course, think about the evaluation criteria that's important. But then they'll also have humans do a small set of that evaluation. So maybe like 50 to 100 of these manual annotations. And from there, you can design LLM automated metrics and measure their correlation and accuracy against the human judgment. Kenny: 30:42 You usually need to iterate a few times to get that custom LLM metric as close as possible to the human judgment. But then once you have that, it's very powerful, right? You have this automated metric that is a very good proxy for human judgment and it's automated, which means you can run it at scale, you can deploy it during evaluation, but also in monitoring as well, and you can also potentially use that as a production guardrail in our firewall. Chris: 31:09 Rick, I was wondering, I know in you know, we've kind of alluded to it that, you know, the the two sides of the equation in terms of testing the models and then monitoring. Could you talk a little about Citadel Lens and Citadel Radar? How you bring them to customers and what the relationship is between those two products that you're bringing to your customers and you know, how do you how do you go to how do you present them when when somebody is interested in, in being able to bring this level of security to the models that they're interested in? Rick: 31:44 Sure. First of all, now we are merging radar features into lens. Lens can provide both testing function and the monitoring function together at this stage. And, as for the the balancing or difference between testing and monitoring, as Kenny mentioned, especially in the case of LLM, how to customize human, say, say, setting back. So so our system is in the concept that the system should follow the human rather than human has to follow the system. Rick: 32:23 In essence, we set the human annotation or human judge as a first priority and try to our metrics to be customized to the human judge. So that is a very important point. And to make it happen, we need to or the customer need to go through testing phase first so that all the metrics should be aligned with the human judgment so that and we can make use of the same custom metrics during the, say, the monitoring phase or fire firewall stage. So in essence, even though final goal might be a monitoring or firewall, but the two before going to that stage, how to test and customize a metrics is very important I mean, very critical, to protect the safety and security and reputational risks. So we recommend strongly recommend to start from testing phase first. Rick: 33:31 So testing phase is not just testing, but customize your metrics into your, say, professional, the person's. So that is a testing phase. And after that, they can go into monitoring phase. So that is our approach to the customers. Daniel: 33:47 And I'm wondering, either one of you could answer this, but why is it and this may be obvious to maybe more of the software engineering type crowd, but maybe less so to some others outside of that crowd. Why is it important to once you've tested your model to actually monitor it online for maybe the things that are are potentially problematic inputs, whether that's a security thing like a prompt injection or, maybe something outside of the you know, some type of input that you wanna filter out like IP going in or something that doesn't fit your policy. Why is it important to have that monitoring piece and not just the testing piece? Because if I test my model and I convince myself that it can't be prompt injected, which I'm saying that sort of in jest because, you know, as you all know, every model there's no perfectly aligned model. There's no every model is vulnerable to various things. Daniel: 34:51 But let's say that I convince myself of high performance in in one of these areas. Why then is it useful and necessary then to monitor that over time or in real time? Rick: 35:04 Technically, probably Kenny is also again the best person. But even if the customers can go through the testing phase, the market condition or say, the human reaction may change over time. So if we do are safe right now, but if anything, say something new happens today, what we say guaranteed today may not apply tomorrow. So it's a very general things. But say, in that sense, keep monitoring is very important to protect our customers, even if the market condition or the world condition change or economic condition change. Kenny: 35:51 Yeah, and just to give a concrete example of why you may want monitoring, so we really view them as complementary, and you really need both, if you want to make a system reliable. So for example, if you have like an answer quality metric that measures how high quality and answers, you should of course use that for testing to make sure that it meets some like, you know, 8090% bar. But then in monitoring, you actually want to measure quality of the real answers that your chatbot is giving to real customers, right. So from a quality perspective, it makes a lot of sense from like a safety and risk reduction perspective. Another example is that, you know, as you mentioned, Dan, during testing, you might test a bunch of prompt injections against your system. Kenny: 36:37 But then in deployment, have real users, some of them are adversarial, some of them are actually trying to prompt inject. They may do it in creative ways that you haven't tested before. You may want some guardrail that will automatically detect those attempts and filter them out, even if you're sure that the model is robust to 90% of these attacks. Chris: 37:00 I'm curious, you guys have some open source available out there. I know one of the tools is lang check. Can you talk a little bit about your approach to open source? Kenny: 37:11 For context, lang check is our open source Python library that contains a suite of metrics that are built in that you can use for evaluating the quality of text. One of our motivations for creating this library is that I think we launched it in October 2023, roughly. And around that time, there weren't a lot of sort of industry standard metrics and practices for evaluating text, particularly in non English languages as well. So there was some focus on, you know, these metrics in English, but we work with a lot of customers that have Japanese texts or Chinese or German and these other languages. We wanted to make a library of these metrics that anyone can use. Kenny: 37:59 We view this as a pretty good starting point. If you just need one or two metrics, you're comfortable writing code, you can use LangeCheck and integrate that into your test pipeline or your monitoring system. But then if you want something production scale, and you want an easy workflow to design custom metrics and test them against manual annotations, that's where our commercial product comes in. Daniel: 38:23 Makes sense, yeah. And as we get a little bit closer to the end here, there's so many things and this is such a, so many in-depth areas to go in, which is why it's great that there's wonderful people like yourselves exploring, the topic. But I'm wondering, if we could maybe talk just a little bit as we close out here about what you're excited about, about kind of, yes, Citadel, but maybe the kind of general ecosystem that that you're a part of. As as you look to the future, you know, what's what's exciting to each of you about how the ecosystem is developing? What's becoming possible with the technology? Daniel: 39:05 What's inspiring to you or what are you thinking about in terms of the future? Maybe I'll start with you, Rick. Rick: 39:13 Okay. So now the chat GPT-five is released. But when we say look back today from say five years later, I believe that, oh, this is a very premature say model or something like that. So in that sense, the technology advancement in the AI field is so rapid. And in that sense, yeah, there may be a lot of risks coming in. Rick: 39:42 But on the other hand, there are mostly infinite opportunities. So you can find that huge variety of possibilities, not only just say the AI directly related technologies, but I believe some of the material products or machines or anything will change maybe within five or ten years. So in essence, we are in the midst of the say period where anything can change in that sense, especially technology related. So there are lots of say risks may come in and we like to protect such a kind of risk as a company. But on the other hand, people can find many possibilities, opportunities for you to try. Rick: 40:35 So I strongly believe that so even though there are lots of issues in the world that people can enjoy or say, make best use of this opportunity, everybody. Daniel: 40:51 Yeah, that's great. What about yourself, Kenny? Kenny: 40:54 Yeah, I think as a consumer of AI in both my personal life and work, from a consumer perspective, it's really exciting to benefit from all the advancements in these new AI tools and models. I really loved Oh, three as a model in chat GBT. And I love using cursor. I'm excited for these tools to become more and more agentic over time. I think that's the trend that you see. Kenny: 41:19 If you just look at ChatGPT, originally it was just 3.5 and GPT-four that just answer a question based on forward pass of the model. But now these models will search the internet and it'll sort of reason and think about what to search next. As a result, the outputs have become a lot better. So really excited for that to improve even more from a consumer perspective. And then from a business perspective, I'm really excited to help bring these capabilities to our business customers and help them use AI more reliably and more effectively in in their business. Daniel: 41:56 That's great. Yeah. Well, thank you both for taking time to to chat with us today. And thank you both for the work and thought that you're putting into the tools that you're building and the open source projects that you're putting out there. It's a great benefit to the to the community and to the business world, of course. Daniel: 42:16 So thank you for the work that you're doing. And, yeah, we'll look forward to, to keeping keeping, an eye on on what you, what you evaluate and and protect us from next. So, appreciate you both, hope you have a great evening.

Good morning, Today\u2019s Stratechery Interview is with Cloudflare co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince . Prince took a fascinating path to Silicon Valley \u2014 which we explore in this interview \u2014\u00a0but is most well-known for Cloudflare, which he started at Harvard Business School in 2009. Cloudflare provides networking services for websites in the cloud, and has one of the most effective and fascinating freemium business models in tech . In this interview we discuss Prince\u2019s background, the original Cloudflare idea, and what Cloudflare is today \u2014\u00a0and the opportunistic way in which it became the company that it is. Prince\u2019s latest focus is the economics of Internet content sites; he is very worried about the impact of AI on the traditional traffic business model that Google created, and is using Cloudflare\u2019s power to try and create a new business model for content. We discuss Prince\u2019s motivations and concerns, and why Prince believes this is a legitimate use of Cloudflare\u2019s power, even if the ultimate decision-maker about the future of the web is Google.

On to the Interview: An Interview with Cloudflare Founder and CEO Matthew Prince About Internet History and Pay-per-crawl This interview is lightly edited for content and clarity. Topics: Background | The Cloudflare Idea | Cloudflare Today | Cloudflare\u2019s Niche | Pay-per-crawl | Cloudflare\u2019s Power | The Google Problem | Cloudflare\u2019s Motivation Background Matthew Prince, welcome back to Stratechery. Matthew Prince: Thanks, Ben. You\u2019re actually one of the earliest Stratechery interview subjects. In fact, I\u2019ve talked to you twice. In both instances, however, the interviews were very focused , primarily on content moderation issues. This was also before I released my recordings of the interview, the modern Stratechery Interview format. To that end, that means I have an opening to still do my regular question for a first-time interview subject: I\u2019ve never asked you your background like how did you get started, how you became interested in tech, take me back to the beginning. MP: I grew up in the mountains of Utah and when I was six years old \u2014 I actually used to think it was seven but my mother corrected me \u2014 when I was six years old in 1980, my grandmother for Christmas gave me an Apple II Plus and I took to it just like a duck to water. The University of Utah has a really actually world-class computer science department, and my mom used to take continuing education classes there and she would sneak me in basically as her precocious kid and she\u2019d pretend to do the work but I\u2019d really do all the homework. Oh, she was actually registered for classes and you were just tagging along? MP: That\u2019s right. And I did things that made you really popular in high school, I went to computer camp, there was a computer camp, we had Cate, the boarding school out in Santa Barbara and I wish I\u2019d stayed in touch with those people because I bet the people who were there with me have gone on to do pretty amazing things. And I went to college thinking I was going to study computer science and then having the hubris of an 18-year-old, I took Computer Science 105 or whatever it was and was bored out of my mind because I\u2019ve been doing this for quite some time. I actually transferred my major to study instead English Literature which is a different direction, but I still knew a lot about computers. I started college in 1992, it\u2019s right as the Internet is taking off and they needed students who had some understanding. I was one of the student network administrators and that\u2019s how I learned how switches and routers and everything worked. I had a fiber optic line straight from my dorm room back to the university\u2019s router, had faster Internet for those first few years than I did for many years since. Oh, yeah. At Wisconsin people generally, I\u2019ve said this before, but people usually only stay in the dorms one year, and me and some of my friends stayed in two years just because that was where you got faster Internet. But we didn\u2019t have fiber optic lines, they were T2s or something like that. MP: Yeah, and that was that. I had offers at the end of college to go do a job that honestly I had no idea what it was but it was a product manager, which I was like, \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d. I think it\u2019s 2025 and no one still knows what it means. MP: And are having to reinvent themselves again. But I think that I had offers at Microsoft and Yahoo and Netscape and I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to do that\u201d, and instead I\u2019ll go to law school, and so I actually went to law school and thought I was going to be a lawyer for a while. And probably but for the dot-com bust, I probably would be. That\u2019s not the answer you would expect, you would think, \u201cThe dot-com bust drove me out of tech\u201d, how does the dot-com bust drive you out of law and into tech? That seems backwards. MP: Well, it kind of drove me into tech a little bit. I had found the type of law that I enjoyed was securities law, which is basically taking companies public and so the summer of 1999, I worked in San Francisco as an intern at a large law firm, we took six companies public over the one summer and it was amazing, it was so much fun. And my plan was go and work for the law firm for a while and then find a company that I thought was really great and help them in financing or whatever. Yeah, be their GC or something. MP: And I\u2019d eventually go in-house, and that was what I thought my journey was going to be. Then the dot-com bust happened in March of 2000 and the law firm called up and said, \u201cHey, good news, bad news. Good news, you still have a job. Bad news, we don\u2019t need any more securities lawyers. But bankruptcy law is basically the same thing and we think you can handle it\u201d. And again, as a lawyer I\u2019m like, \u201cIt kind of is the same thing\u201d. A lot less fun. MP: There\u2019s no in-house left after the company has gone bankrupt. So there\u2019s a guy named Doug Lichtman who\u2019s a young law professor who would always come over to my apartment and we\u2019d share a bottle of wine and he\u2019s like, \u201cMy brother is starting a B2B company in the insurance space and they\u2019re looking for someone with your skill set, would you be interested?\u201d, and I was like, \u201cYeah, that sounds amazing\u201d, and maybe they\u2019d match your salary and they\u2019ll give you this thing called stock. I was like, \u201cYeah, sure\u201d, and so I did that and we raised about $6 million. It was the same business model as almost like Rippling today but it was way before its time. And we were idiots and we blew it up in every possible way and so we blew through $6 million over the course of about 18 months and it was a colossal failure, but it was just incredible to see that a group of people could come together with an idea on a piece of paper, try to build something, fail, fail honorably. Again, I think it just wasn\u2019t the right time and then no one went to jail, which was pretty amazing. We lost all this money from the investors and the investors were like, \u201cYeah, that sucks, if you guys start something new, let us know\u201d, and I was like, \u201cWow, this is some sort of magical world I didn\u2019t know existed\u201d. So I then spent the next eight years trying to find my way back to that, although largely wandered in the wilderness. I was a bartender, I taught LSAT test prep, I did a bunch of just odd jobs just to make ends meet. This is when you started Unspam , right? MP: Yeah. And you wrote a paper about the CAN-SPAM Act , I think you were teaching a law course about that. What got you interested in spam of all things? MP: I thought it was an interesting legal question. It is with a very few exceptions, until the Internet comes along, there aren\u2019t a lot of ways to be sitting in one place and commit a crime on the opposite side of the earth. There were some, you could do postal fraud and a couple of things, but all of a sudden that became a real thing that was happening at real scale. And then secondly, it was the first time that you could be sitting in one place of the world, send an email to another place, potentially commit a crime and not even know you were doing it because you don\u2019t have any sort of jurisdiction which is attached to it and so I thought that the question of how you were going to apply jurisdictional laws to things like cyberspace was a really interesting question. Again, I was playing law professor largely, I was an adjunct which was the lowest tier of professor at a law school that doesn\u2019t exist anymore, that\u2019s how bad it was. (laughing) Was this University of Chicago Illinois or\u2026? MP: It\u2019s not the University of Chicago, University of Chicago is terrific, it was John Marshall Law School in Chicago, which does not exist anymore. But it gave me an excuse to think about and write about things and I had a thing that was today we call blog but it was before that term had been even coined. I think the same way that you get to write and talk about things that you\u2019re interested in, that was a period of my life that I got to do that. My parents were deeply worried that I would never make anything of myself and I honestly was a little bit worried about the same thing, but I think it was actually really important for just having the perspective to then go on and start Cloudflare. What was was Unspam specifically though? MP: Unspam initially started out as being a cool domain that I had registered and I was like, \u201cWhat can I do with this?\u201d, and the first thing we tried to do is disposable email addresses, the same thing Apple does now where you can basically have an email address and then if people start sending you stuff you don\u2019t want, you turn the email address off and it goes away. I started doing this in college in the 1990s where I still have this domain that I use for all these email addresses, it turns out it\u2019s actually a very difficult way to live. MP: (laughing) I have that same problem. There are so many assumptions built into having a common email address across different places that it\u2019s actually pretty tough. I\u2019m stuck with it now! MP: Yes. Well, we should commiserate over this at some point because I have the same problem. And also just explaining to someone and you\u2019re talking to the customer service agent at Nordstrom, and they\u2019re like, \u201cOkay, what\u2019s your email?\u201d, and I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, it\u2019s nordstrom\u2026\u201d Nordstrom@domain.com. MP: And they\u2019re like, \u201cNo, no, no. What\u2019s your email?\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cWait, do you work for us?\u201d MP: And then, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d So yes, I\u2019ve had many of those. That\u2019s where we started. We then got the Do Not Call list was coming along so the question was, \u201cCould you build something like the Do Not Call list but for email?\u201d, and so we ended up being strangely a government contractor where we worked with various states. Originally, we started out actually with Chuck Schumer and the CAN-SPAM Act but the federal government never implemented it. But Michigan and Utah and a couple of other states implemented this thing that basically said if you put your email on a list, then they would maintain the list and then what we did was we just provided hashing technology where we\u2019d hash the marketer\u2019s list, we\u2019d hash the government\u2019s list, and we\u2019d compare the two. So neither side knew what was on the others list and it wasn\u2019t world-changing technology but the company is still around, it\u2019s profitable but it was never going to be a really, really big business. You have an undergraduate degree in English, you go to law school, and then you decide, \u201cOh, I need to get an MBA as well\u201d, you go to HBS. Did you have an idea that you want \u2014 was that a, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with my life so I\u2019m going to go to Harvard?\u201d \u2014 which is a lot of people do things like that. Was it a, \u201cI specifically want to gain some sort of knowledge, I want to start a business?\u201d, what\u2019s the sequence of events here given that Cloudflare the idea started there in Cambridge? MP: I started Unspam and Unspam was floundering along and not doing very well. And my dad \u2014 we\u2019d grown up upper-middle class and my dad owned a bunch of restaurants \u2014 not good restaurants \u2014 like Applebee\u2019s, Famous Dave\u2019s Bar-B-Que, he had the only Hooters in Utah. An adventure in its own right. MP: Yeah, and he was in his late 60s and he called me up and he said, \u201cSon, I\u2019ve taken care of you a lot of your life and it\u2019s time for you to come run the family business\u201d, and I couldn\u2019t imagine anything worse than running my dad\u2019s Hooters. So the idea of going to business school was, I was on my second bottle of wine trying to figure out, \u201cHow the hell am I going to get out of this?\u201d, because it was a good business and someone needed to run it and I thought, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll apply to business school\u201d. I applied to eight business schools, the night the applications were due, I ended up getting rejected from seven of them and then somehow got into HBS and called my dad and said, \u201cHey\u2026\u201d. \u201cI really want to do it but I need to go get some training first!\u201d MP: \u201cI really wanted to do it but I need two years to try and do this business thing, I think I should understand accounting a little bit better\u201d, and he was like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a really good idea, you should do that\u201d. So I went off and I had a Voice-over-IP phone that I was in the dorms, this tiny little dorm in Alston, in Cambridge, and I plugged my Voice-over-IP line in so I still was working for Unspam, the phone rang, I\u2019d pick it up, and then I was doing business school stuff. I was much older than the usual business student and I taught law, which it was like this total unlock where I was like, \u201cOh my gosh, everyone does grad school wrong and especially business school wrong\u201d. How so? MP: They think that the goal of the class is to think of the clever thing that no one has ever thought of before, which leads you down a bad path. Whereas really the goal if you\u2019re faculty is to take students on a Socratic journey to make a point, and you start at point A and end in point B and you can figure out what that arc is. So the way that I approached business school was I would just say \u2014 whenever someone would have some crazy point, I just try and get us back on the arc, and that made me every faculty member\u2019s closest friend. Especially with the Harvard teaching style with the cases and things like that where they\u2019re trying to guide a discussion, it\u2019s not necessarily a lecture, I can see that appealing for sure. MP: Yeah. It was funny, in almost every class because they\u2019d get descriptions of who the students were, the faculty about three lectures in would come up to me and they\u2019d say, \u201cSo you used to teach law school?\u201d, and I was like, \u201cYeah\u201d, and they\u2019d say, \u201cNothing like a lawyer to ruin a good conversation\u201d, and I said, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s true\u201d, he said, \u201cHere\u2019s the deal. I won\u2019t embarrass you if you don\u2019t embarrass me\u201d, and I said, \u201cDeal\u201d. So business school at that point became just a lot of fun and I did pretty well at it. But mostly I was spending that time just trying to figure out what can I figure out to do that won\u2019t have me go back and run my dad\u2019s Hooters? The Cloudflare Idea Where did the Cloudflare idea come from? Was that directly downstream from the Unspam work? You can certainly see the links there. What\u2019s the connection to Clayton Christensen and disruption? You\u2019ve talked about that in retrospect but it\u2019s one of those things when you look backwards, you can paint this picture of I learned about disruption, I wanted to start this company that served an underserved market. Is that how it worked or what was the actual progression? MP: These things all start with people. There were two people who were critically important, one was an employee at Unspam, this guy named Lee Holloway who we\u2019d hired straight out of college and was just \u2014 there are some people that are just real technical geniuses, and Lee was this incredible technical genius and we built the core technology for Unspam but we also had all these side projects. One of those side projects was a thing called Project Honey Pot which actually built \u2014 Paul Graham , the Y Combinator guy, before Paul did Y Combinator, he would host a conference at MIT called the MIT Anti-Spam Conference, and he invited me out one year to give a talk on how to write laws to throw spammers in jail, that went over pretty well. He\u2019s like, \u201cCome back, just do the same talk\u201d, I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not going to do the same talk, I\u2019m the lawyer, I\u2019m not going to do the same talk to a bunch of technologists, they were polite the first time\u201d, and he\u2019s like, \u201cOh, you\u2019ll come up with something\u201d. So I went back to Lee and I was like, \u201cCould we build a system to track how basically bad guys steal your email address?\u201d, that turned into something called Project Honey Pot . Gave the talk, it was wildly popular, put it in the corner, and over the course of the next few years, over 100,000 people signed up for this service. And Lee was there, Lee at the time, while I\u2019d gone off to business school, he continued to do technical work at Unspam. But it was not the highest, most interesting technical work, and he had called me and said, \u201cHey, you\u2019ve always been really good to me but\u2026\u201d, and at that point in the conversation, I was like, \u201cStop right there, give me some time, I\u2019ll figure something out\u201d. Because Lee was one of those people you just wanted to have on your team, he had offers at Google and Facebook and that. On the other side, a lot of people in business school are obnoxious, but there was this one woman who was really just genuinely trying to find the right answer and had no vanity about the whole thing, and that was Michelle [Zatlyn] . Michelle was clearly the opposite of me, and I\u2019m not the most organized person, I\u2019m not the most disciplined, I\u2019m not about process. Michelle was a Six Sigma Black Belt and she\u2019s just all of those things and with Unspam, I had started with two other friends and we fought like crazy and so I was really trying to look for people that had real difference from who I was, and Michelle was just this all of the things that I was bad at, she was amazing at. So I was always pitching her on various ideas. Most of my ideas were \u2014 they were really, in retrospect, terrible ideas. But one of them I was telling her about Project Honey Pot, and she was just perplexed by the thing. She was like, \u201cWhy do people sign up for this?\u201d, and I was like, \u201cBecause we track the bad guys\u201d, and she\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, but it takes effort, do you give them anything?\u201d, and we\u2019re like, \u201cWell, they get recognition for what they\u2019ve done\u201d, she\u2019s like, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense, why would anyone do this?\u201d. And I, frustrated at an Ethiopian restaurant in Central Square in Cambridge, I said, \u201cMichelle, someday they want us to stop them\u201d, and she said, \u201cThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s the idea, let\u2019s build that\u201d. And literally that night I called Lee and I pitched, \u201cHey, here\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work, we\u2019re going to do it this way\u201d, and I spent 30 minutes just walking him through the entire idea that Michelle and I had sketched out. At the end of it, he stopped for about five minutes, to the point I thought the line had gone dead, and at the end of it he was like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019ll work, let\u2019s do that\u201d, and that was the start. So it was Lee, Michelle and I were the original three co-founders of the company, it started as a school project. The original idea was, \u201cCould you take a firewall and put it in the cloud?\u201d, so Cloudflare is us playing with firewall in the cloud. And for at least the first five years, what we kind of outlined over the course of the next few days turned out to be a almost perfect roadmap for what happened over the next five years. So you have this service that is super beneficial for tiny websites, you can sign up for Cloudflare for free to protect you from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. It has this really virtuous cycle where ISPs are grateful that you exist because you consume a lot of bad traffic, that they\u2019re happy to have you on board, this gives you a better service. It\u2019s really the growth story, which I\u2019ve written about , is really compelling and interesting. And as you\u2019ve articulated, there is this disruption angle where you\u2019re approaching the problem from a completely different approach of say, a public cloud or certainly on-premise software. You couldn\u2019t be more different than that. Is this a thing where you had the agreements with your professors? You\u2019re not going to make a fool out of them. So did you walk in to Professor Christensen and be like, \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019ve already done this\u201d, or what is the connection there? MP: I was taking, I have to remember, I think I had just finished Clay\u2019s course when we started working on Cloudflare so it was coming really fresh out of that and Clay and I had, I think, a really very strong relationship and I just loved the course and got to take it from him. Early on, I think that it gave us the confidence. We knew it\u2019s really hard to build businesses unless they\u2019re consumer, but even then it\u2019s really hard, but it\u2019s really hard to build big businesses in a B2B space on 20 bucks a month fees. There\u2019s a reason everyone ends up getting sales forces and selling to big companies. MP: That\u2019s right. So we knew the only way it would work is if we got to the point where we\u2019re selling for tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, which we do today, to big enterprises. But the question is how do you get from here to there? I think because of the nature that we had to build this network out because we needed data and because I\u2019d come out of Clay\u2019s class, I think that all gave us the confidence to say, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to start focusing on how do we provide a service for free that\u2019ll be stripped down and limited in a bunch of ways, but make it better than anything else that\u2019s out there and then continue to move up market\u201d. And at some point, we would cross the point where the features that we had would be more than what people could get from the alternatives, which were companies like Akamai and the on-premise hardware folks. Then the hyperscalers were sort of emerging at that point and that\u2019s exactly what happened. It\u2019s interesting today because at some level we just had the belief that if enough of the Internet flowed through us, we\u2019d find some way to make a business around it and we really did believe in the mission of helping build a better Internet and I think those two things together have allowed us to have the success and get the scale that we have today. Is it ironic or maybe intentional that this sort of boutique interest you had in crimes being committed across the world, no longer limited by geography, basically you need some sort of push to get people into your business and so the criminals were actually your most important, they were your salespeople, they created the market for you? MP: Yeah, we\u2019ve never thought about it that way, and there have been various times that there have been hackers who have been like, \u201cI\u2019m reformed, I want to get a job\u201d, and we\u2019ve been like, \u201cYeah, not so sure\u201d. But I think that the Internet is a complicated place. Early on people would say, \u201cWho\u2019s your competition?\u201d, and I said, \u201cFacebook\u201d, and I actually still believe that\u2019s really true. I think had Cloudflare not come to exist, much more of the Internet would\u2019ve existed on Facebook because it was becoming too difficult as a small website owner to put up with the hassle of it and so people were racing behind the walled gardens that were out there. What we tried to do is say, \u201cHey, let\u2019s give you still the freedom to innovate, but help you have the kind of protection that you don\u2019t have to worry about all of the nasty things that are out there\u201d, and so I think in the same way that Amazon is to Shopify, Facebook is to Cloudflare. Not a perfect analogy, but I think we try to be the minimum amount and then let just any type of creativity or uniqueness happen behind the scenes, whereas the walled gardens are a different thing. Cloudflare Today What is Cloudflare today and how would you contrast that to the idea 10, 15 years ago? And is this a path that is about the path you expected to walk down with some obviously diverges along the way, or have you ended up in a different spot than you expected? MP: I think the real story of Cloudflare is that we wanted to put a firewall in the cloud, and we knew that in order to sell to JP Morgan and governments and big hospital groups and things like that, we had to start small and work our way up, so we made the service free. What we didn\u2019t expect was the number of problems that that would create. All the world humanitarian organizations were sort of our first customers because they had big security problems and small budgets, and so they all signed up and then people would try and DDoS attack them or hack them in various ways. Not ideal customers. MP: Well, again, in some way, perfectly ideal customers because we learned a ton, but then we would stop them. But then all the hacker kids are like, \u201cWow, these guys are pretty good, I\u2019m going to sign up because all my friends are trying to hack me\u201d. So then all the hackers are on us, but then the hackers try and push us in every possible way. So why did we build a domain name registrar ? It\u2019s a terrible business, it is a commodity, why would we do it? Because we looked at everybody else and no one else was secure, and we came this close for cloudflare.com getting hacked, and that would\u2019ve been a disaster. So we were like, \u201cThe only way we can solve this is to bring it in-house\u201d. Why did we build our VPN replacement series of products ? Because we looked at all of the other folks that were in the space and we\u2019re like, these guys, they just can\u2019t deal with the scale and complexity of everything that we have, so we\u2019ve just got to go build it ourselves. Why did we build a developer platform ? It wasn\u2019t because we thought we were going to sell it, we built it, we needed it ourselves, we needed a sandbox environment so we could build things. Now, all of those things turned into substantial kind of product lines for us. But really Cloudflare is the story of we create a series of problems and then we solve them ourselves, and in the process that turns into products. I would\u2019ve never imagined \u2014 the very first meeting we had with venture capital, this guy named Ray Rothrock who was the first money into Cloudflare, and we pitched him and he says, \u201cGreat, I only have one question\u201d, and we\u2019re like, \u201cOkay, what?\u201d, he\u2019s like, \u201cWhat are you going to do about the death threats?\u201d, and I was like, \u201cDeath threats?\u201d, and Michelle was like, \u201cWhat are you even talking about?\u201d. (laughing) The uncertainty that the black belt six sigma does not want in their life. MP: And he\u2019s like, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do this, you\u2019re going to piss a whole bunch of people off\u201d, and so I would\u2019ve never imagined that I\u2019d be personally sanctioned by the Russian government and supposedly on some Putin kill list, that wasn\u2019t what I was signing up for and so I think that we have done something which is very different. I think because of the fact that we\u2019ve made it available so broadly, we end up touching a bunch of content, that then means from time to time \u2014 although it\u2019s interesting, you said the two times we\u2019ve talked before were all about content moderation. I was going to ask you, is the topic dead? It doesn\u2019t seem to come up much anymore. MP: Well, so we\u2019re 15 years old in September. We\u2019ve had three major incidents of this where there\u2019s stuff that\u2019s illegal, we take down all the time, but for the kind of stuff that\u2019s immoral but not illegal, there\u2019s this sort of gray line that\u2019s there, three incidents over 15 years. So the mean time to incident is five years, we\u2019re due for another one. There\u2019s going to be something, I don\u2019t know what it will be. But inherently, if you sit behind enough of the Internet \u2014 right now, we\u2019re being sued in Italy, Spain, a bunch of other places and it is largely because people who own football teams, soccer teams, they don\u2019t like people illegally streaming their content. We don\u2019t like people illegally streaming their content, it burns through a bunch of bandwidth. We try and shut it down, but they\u2019re very clever, so they find different ways to do it. So we\u2019re in these fights where we\u2019re kind of like, we\u2019re trying to not have this happen, and so I think that the nature of what we do is going to always have some controversy that\u2019s around it. But frankly, that\u2019s kind of what makes it so interesting as well because we do find ourselves in the middle of some really interesting policy debates. I do want to come back to that in a little bit, but one thing that I think defines Cloudflare, and this is always interesting, you have these product weeks where you have 47 announcements, it\u2019s hard to parse them all. What I like about companies that do that, this was like Nvidia back in the day, they knew they had something with GPUs and CUDA and they would throw so much spaghetti against the wall, every single GTC, they\u2019d have it twice a year and people would ask me, \u201cHow do they do this?\u201d, I\u2019m like , \u201cWell, because it\u2019s all the same platform, it\u2019s just everything is sort of software defined, so they\u2019re actually just releasing these libraries that are marginally different from each other, but they can frame them as being different things\u201d. That\u2019s sort of like Cloudflare, you have this common architecture on commodity hardware. Was that very purposeful from the beginning or is that a similar function of, \u201cWe\u2019re a scrappy little startup putting a server in an ISP, we can\u2019t afford anything more than a Pentium or whatever it might be\u201d, and it turns out that actually ended up being the way to build out infrastructure? MP: Yeah, I think we were really inspired by the Google story of, if you think of who was the leading search engine before Google launched? It was AltaVista. And who built AltaVista? Digital Equipment Corporation. What was Digital Equipment Corporation\u2019s business? They sold mainframes. Why did they launch a search engine? It was a demo on how powerful their mainframes were. And so then Larry [Page] and Sergey [Brin] come around as Stanford students, and the key innovation of Google isn\u2019t actually search, it\u2019s their ability to store and process data much more efficiently than anyone else, being cheaper and faster than anyone else, and that they could scale the mainframe to be infinitely large effectively and they did it by just taking a bunch of commodity hardware. We, from the beginning I think, I was firmly in this camp, Lee was firmly in this camp. There\u2019s some people on our team who were not firmly in this camp, and so there were fights early on about whether we should have specialized hardware to do various functions, or we should take commodity hardware and then write the clever software to do scheduling and everything else that you needed. Again, that\u2019s one of those debates. We were eight people above a nail salon in Palo Alto, and it could have gone either way. If it had gone a different direction, we wouldn\u2019t be the company we are today. Today still, almost every server that makes up Cloudflare, is one of a different generation. I think we\u2019re on generation 13 now and we\u2019ll buy the servers in bulk. The servers now have five major components. So they\u2019ve got network, CPU, GPU now, long-term storage and then short-term storage, so SSDs and then RAM. We\u2019re constantly asking ourselves, and this is where a lot of innovation, there\u2019s a once a quarter meeting that our infrastructure team and our product team have that they call a hot and cold meeting and they ask the question everyone asks, which is, \u201cWhere are we running hot?\u201d, and then the question is, \u201cCan we do engineering to make that more efficient or do we have to deploy more hardware in those places?\u201d. But they ask the equally important question of, \u201cWhere are we running cold?\u201d, and that I think is the more interesting thing, which is, \u201cWhere are those opportunities where we\u2019ve already paid for a resource, it exists in the wild, but it\u2019s not being utilized enough, what can we go build on that resource?\u201d. My somewhat distasteful maybe analogy to this is if somebody came up with the idea of selling the advertising space above urinals in bathrooms and bars, I can tell someone thought of doing that, it wasn\u2019t worth anything, the minute someone did it, you\u2019re all of a sudden generating a new stream of revenue from that. Cloudflare is asking that question all the time, which is, \u201cWhere is that kind of extra space, extra capacity?\u201d, and then if we can sell that, then we have higher margins and it allows us to continue to do all the things we do. What\u2019s the split then of business that\u2019s opportunistic versus very intentional and you\u2019re pointing to it for a long time? MP: We are not the place where we come up with hundred page business cases. I mean, again, we built Cloudflare Workers because we needed it and now it\u2019s the fastest growing part of our business. Cloudflare\u2019s Niche You\u2019ve talked about being a fourth cloud in the past, I wrote about that , I feel like I haven\u2019t heard as much about it as late. Did the public clouds respond faster to that than you expected, whether it be Lambda and things like that or what? MP: I think what\u2019s happened is that we\u2019ve each carved out our lanes and while we compete at the margins, we are very distinct in those lanes. The analogy is, I think that companies have personalities just like employees that do various jobs functions have. The hyperscalers, so AWS, Google, Microsoft Azure, their job function personality is the DBA, the database administrator. And if you\u2019ve ever worked with DBAs, they are brilliant, but they\u2019re oftentimes kind of rigid. They see the database as the center of the world, the entire thing they\u2019re doing is all the data has to be in the database. To be fair, the database is kind of the center of the world, in their defense. MP: It can be. Again, that is one way you are showing your colors, I guess. The other version, which is more us, is the network administrators. It\u2019s funny you mentioned that, actually for the business of Stratechery and Passport, the stuff that I work on, I think a lot about databases. It\u2019s actually really important! MP: I think a lot about networks, you think a lot about databases. But the functions of those two things are actually really, they\u2019re not diametrically opposed, but there\u2019s tension between them, because the purpose of the database is to hold onto the data and store it no matter what. The purpose of the network is to move the data and get it off your system as fast as you possibly can and those are two very different things. So if you\u2019re really good at databases, you\u2019re probably not going to be really good at networks and if you\u2019re really good at networks, you\u2019re probably not going to be really good at databases, and I think that\u2019s true. I think that the networking products of the hyperscalers kind of suck because they don\u2019t actually want data to leave and our database products, honestly, aren\u2019t as good as the hyperscaler products. Again, they have certain advantages, there are times when you want to use them and you don\u2019t want to use theirs, but they\u2019re definitely tertiary to what it is that we are doing as a business. I think that a bad outcome in the future for Cloudflare is one where the world becomes more unicloud where everyone says, \u201cI am a hundred percent all in on AWS\u201d, in that case, there\u2019s not a lot for us to do. A good outcome for Cloudflare in the future is a world where you are more multi-cloud, in which case then the network becomes the things that rationalizes between the different cloud providers. Is this the area where AI has actually been positive for you? Not so much in building AI products, but in the fact that it\u2019s given a motivation for companies to be more multi-cloud? MP: Yeah, I think that\u2019s true. And I think also, yeah, and you\u2019ve got big data sets that you have to move around in ways, we\u2019re really good at that. There\u2019s just a lot of things where for one reason or another \u2014 if you\u2019re building an agent today, probably Cloudflare Workers is the best place to build it. You can spin it up, you can spin it down, it can connect all around. It\u2019s got to pass through us anyway because we\u2019re such a large portion of the Internet and so that has been, I think that actually the sort of AI and AI agents has been the killer app for Cloudflare Workers, but it\u2019s less about how \u2014 we\u2019re never going to be the right place to run SAP HANA , but we\u2019re definitely the right place to run the agents that have to interact with the rest of and move around the Internet. Pay-per-crawl The reason to talk now, and we\u2019ve talked offline about this a few times, both this year and last year, is your push for this pay-per-crawl concept . Why don\u2019t you give me the high level overview, the pitch from your perspective, which I think has evolved? I would like to think partially based on some of my feedback, but what\u2019s the pitch in September 2025? MP: Let\u2019s take Cloudflare out for a second and just talk about\u2014 Talk about Matthew, the English student? The student newspaper editor. MP: This is me channeling inner law professor. Let me give you the history of the Internet and why the Internet exists the way that it does and what\u2019s changing. This is usually my job, but go ahead. MP: And you can tell me where I\u2019m wrong, but this is my quick history of the Internet, and apologies to Michelle who hates history lessons. For the last 25 years, the interface of the Internet has been search, and Google has dominated that space, and Google, their incentives as a company were to have the Internet grow as much as possible because if you have chaos, then the search becomes the organizer of the chaos. But you need incentives for people to actually create content and so Google not only had to create the thing that organized the Internet, but they then had to take the thing that took the traffic of where people went and then helped people monetize that, largely through advertising, although they also helped with subscriptions, and Google was the great patron of the Internet for the last 25 years. The web would not exist the way it does if there were not something like Google out there to create the incentives around. There were a lot of problems with incentivizing around traffic, we created systems where people would just literally try and create rage-baity headlines to get people to click on things so that they could put ads against them and so not perfect, but we don\u2019t have the Internet that we have today unless we have Google and search funding that. That is changing. The world is shifting where the interface of the web is shifting from search engines and search engines give you a treasure map and say, \u201cHey, go figure out what your answer is by clicking on these 10 blue links\u201d, to what are effectively answer engines. So if you look at OpenAI, if you look at Anthropic, if you look at Perplexity, even if you look at modern Google, they are not a search engine, they don\u2019t give you a treasure map. Instead, they give you an answer right at the top of that page. That answer, for most users, 95% of the users, 95% of the time, it\u2019s a better user interface. I\u2019m not anti-answer engines, I\u2019m not anti-AI, I think it\u2019s better in every possible way for that to be what the interface is that we all interact with. But the problem is that if you get the answer and you don\u2019t get a treasure map, then you don\u2019t generate traffic and if you don\u2019t generate traffic, then the entire business model of the web, which has been based on traffic starts to break down and you can see that, not so much in e-commerce sites, not so much in things that actually sell you the physical thing because if you asked what\u2019s the best camera to buy, even if you get an answer, you\u2019ve still got to go buy it from somewhere. It\u2019s going to take the e-commerce and the people who are selling things that\u2019s going to work but the person who wrote the review\u2014 The great thing about physical products is by definition they are scarce and the problem with text on the Internet is it is not scarce. MP: It\u2019s not scarce, that\u2019s exactly right, and Google set this expectation that everybody can scrape the Internet for free, but it was never free. The Internet has never been free. Google paid for it for a really long time and the quid pro quo with the content creators was, \u201cWe get a copy of your content and in exchange we\u2019ll send you traffic and help you monetize that traffic\u201d. That quid pro quo breaks down as we shift from search engines to answer engines and so something is going to change. I see three possible outcomes for that. And again, none of this involves \u2014 if Cloudflare disappeared tomorrow, this is still happening, one of these three things will happen. One, all of the journalists, academics, and researchers in the world will starve to death and die. And it\u2019s crazy, like when you post this stuff on Twitter, how many people were like, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t really need journalists anymore, we have drones\u201d, and I\u2019m like, \u201cI think we still need journalists\u201d. This is the point that I make a lot because people will hold up Stratechery as a model for journalism in the future, and subscriptions and the whole small scale subscription model. I\u2019m very proud of Stratechery\u2019s role in figuring that out, but I\u2019ve always said, look, my Articles are generally completely fresh content, but my Updates, how do I always open them? By quoting from a journalist like, \u201cOkay, now I\u2019m going to analyze this piece of news that someone actually collected\u201d, so I\u2019m with you on that point. MP: And how would you know what to write about, you\u2019re derivative of those things. That\u2019s great, and I think that adds an enormous value, and I think as you\u2019ve said in the past, there will still be tentpole content that\u2019s out there that people will have to have. But there\u2019s a whole bunch of other stuff like what happened in the world that somebody has to report on, and again, there is a real risk that if the business model completely dies, that that goes away, and I think that would be a loss. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be the outcome. Don\u2019t you think that that\u2019s already happened to a certain extent though? People worry, complain about there\u2019s lots of national coverage, but say on a local basis, the local newspapers being decimated by the Internet and don\u2019t make any money, don\u2019t have reporters, who knows the City Hall is doing, et cetera. MP: I think that that\u2019s the Google model of paying for traffic doesn\u2019t support local media in the same way. My wife and I bought the local newspaper in our hometown, it actually turns out to be a pretty good little business, surprisingly. I\u2019m a big advocate . I think that local news actually could be. MP: Well, I think it\u2019s going to become massively more valuable and so we\u2019ll get to that. The second possible outcome \u2014 Sorry, you didn\u2019t make the agreement that you made with your professors, you had to tell me to let you cook and not keep interrupting you and being a pain. Sorry, continue. MP: No, it\u2019s fine. Sorry, continue. MP: It\u2019s your newsletter and show. Continue, continue. MP: I\u2019m just the entertainment! The second option is that \u2014 and I don\u2019t think this is outlandish, but I think it is a Black Mirror option, which is that, can you imagine Sam Altman announces tomorrow he\u2019s standing up his own version of the Associated Press? Yes, I can. MP: See what I\u2019m saying, can you imagine he announces he\u2019s bought Gartner? It\u2019s not insane. It could be that we don\u2019t go back to a media time of the 1900s, we go back to a media time of the 1400s, and it\u2019s like the Medici\u2019s, you\u2019ve got five powerful families that control and pay for all of the different content creation which is out there, in which case it is likely that there\u2019s a conservative one, there\u2019s a liberal one, there\u2019s a Chinese one, there will be an Indian one. The Europeans will try to build one and then it won\u2019t work, and they\u2019ll use the liberal US one and that could very well be what happens with content. I think that that\u2019s not inconceivable, and it\u2019s not actually that many far degrees away from what Scale AI was doing where you\u2019re sorting and organizing content for people and tokenizing it. There are a lot of unemployed journalists, it\u2019s not that expensive to stand up a bunch of bureaus, but I think that\u2019s a really dangerous outcome because it\u2019s incredibly regressive where the Internet was this great leveler, this great distributor of knowledge. If all of a sudden we\u2019re all spending thousands of dollars a year on whichever AI system, even the wealthy will probably pick one, and if the knowledge that you get all comes from that one, all of a sudden we\u2019ve siloed things again and that seems really, really risky, but not totally inconceivable. What\u2019s number three? MP: Number three is we figure out a new business model, and it has to be some version of the revenue that is generated by the AI companies, the answer engines that are out there, some portion of it goes back to the content creators. And how that works again, I think is what we\u2019re trying to figure out. But I think that there are really three things today that you need to be an AI company. You need access to GPUs and OpenAI spends over $10 billion a year on that, but it\u2019s silicon and like all silicon over time it will become more and more of a commodity, it just will because there\u2019s never been a silicon shortage that hasn\u2019t turned into a silicon glut. Everyone in the world is racing to compete with Nvidia, Nvidia might stay in the lead for a really long time, but you\u2019re going to have AMD and Qualcomm and Apple and all the hyperscalers come up with new things. We just need to keep Taiwan intact. MP: We do need to keep Taiwan intact. And you moving, you were the front line of defense as far as I heard. Family reasons\u2026 MP: The only thing that kept the Chinese away was Ben. The second thing is talent \u2014 today we have an enormous shortage because frankly, if you were getting a PhD in AI five years ago, you were a laughingstock. It was a dead space. Today it\u2019s the hottest space, everyone\u2019s turning up a new thing and so we\u2019re going to go probably not from a shortage to a glut, but you\u2019re certainly not \u2014 the days of a billion dollars to come work at Meta if you\u2019re a great AI researcher, those days are limited and it\u2019s not going to be that way forever. We\u2019re going to have a lot more people who are flocking to this because education markets and employment markets are efficient. The third thing that you need is content. And again, we have this expectation because of Google, that content should be available to all the robots for free, but that\u2019s not sustainable. You end up in either everyone dies of hunger or we live in the time of the Medicis in those models, so in some way we\u2019ve got to figure out a new quid pro quo. You could think about it as $1 per monthly active user per year for any of the AI companies goes into a pool that then gets distributed to content creators. If you do the math, that\u2019s about $10 billion today in terms of content, that would entirely replace all of the ad revenue that is generated by the non-walled garden Internet today, so take Instagram and Facebook and TikTok and those- Like the Google networks, TradeDesk, etc. MP: But include the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, the FT, Reddit, everything else, it\u2019s about $10 billion a year. That\u2019s a lot of money, but that\u2019s not a crazy amount of money. And if we can figure that out, we can actually then create a better business model, which if we do it right, I think it actually encourages better media and better content to be created at the same time. You talked about earlier the question of getting from here to there, which is certainly the question that applies here. There\u2019s also the issue of what we want to happen versus fighting economics and the fact that text is infinitely replicable and can be spread and you put years into worrying about spam, spam is still a problem. MP: Sort of. Not the problem it used to be. Honestly, if you\u2019re \u2014 I remember when Bill Gates was like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to solve spam in the next five years\u201d, and I was like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not, this is an intractable problem\u201d. Actually, they largely did. It all comes out on the backs of people like me just trying to send an honest newsletter to people\u2019s inboxes. MP: It makes it harder for you, yes. When you think about this and what you can do, how do you separate the, \u201cOkay, this is what I want to happen\u201d, versus, \u201cThis is what is possible to happen and there are actually levers that I can pull to make it happen\u201d? MP: I think the first thing is that all markets require scarcity, you can\u2019t have a market if you don\u2019t have scarcity, there has to be some scarcity that exists in that market. But that\u2019s the problem with the Internet is 45% of the people might decide to buy into this concept, but then the 55% just run the table. MP: Potentially, but if they don\u2019t have access to the content, then it becomes harder. And so what we\u2019ve just seen is that for content creators that are out there, especially if they create scarcity, they actually are able then to do deals. So you look at Reddit. Reddit has been very aggressive at stopping bots from scraping their content, including Google. They said, \u201cGoogle, you don\u2019t get access to this unless you pay for it\u201d, and as a result Google and OpenAI struck a deal with Reddit where they pay \u2014 we know from their public filings that this isn\u2019t anything that is confidential \u2014 but in 2024 they got $120 million for 2024 and I\u2019m told that the deal in 2025 was even better. I think that you\u2019ll see that going up. What I think is actually really interesting is if you count up the number of tokens in Reddit and the number of tokens in the total catalog of The New York Times, it turns out about the same within an order of magnitude, and yet Reddit got seven times as much. The question is why? And I think answer is because The New York Times \u2014 you might love The New York Times, but the difference between The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the FT, the Washington Post, and the Boston Globe from the perspective of an LLM is actually not that much. The facts are the facts are the facts. And so yes, there\u2019s some color and there\u2019s different slants, and the opinion pages might be slightly different, but it\u2019s kind of the same. So I actually think the thing that\u2019s really encouraging is we already see that where scarcity exists and where content is unique, like if you don\u2019t have Reddit, you don\u2019t have Reddit, so you need to have that content. I think that if we can create scarcity in these cases, what the market will show is that it\u2019s actually that local, unique, differentiated content, which is the most valuable and as this market for content exists and comes on to being, again, regardless of Cloudflare, if Cloudflare disappears, I still think that it is inevitable that publishers will say, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to shut down the access of the bots to have access to our stuff, and then we\u2019re going to create a market for the most unique stuff\u201d. And the more unique it is, the more you\u2019ll get paid for it, I think that that\u2019s just inevitable. I think that this is one of those seminal moments where we\u2019re shifting the business model of the web and I\u2019m actually super encouraged that the future of content is going to be much more like early Internet than, and again, with all due respect to my friend Ben Smith, BuzzFeed. Cloudflare\u2019s Power If it\u2019s inevitable though, then why does Cloudflare need to be so aggressive? You\u2019re instituting these policies of doing your best to block bots, putting together protocols for recognizing what it\u2019s worth, payments, etc., all very nascent to be sure, a lot to be figured out. But you are not taking the posture of a company that this is inevitable and it\u2019s going to be great, you are being pretty forceful in trying to make something happen. MP: Well, I think if we weren\u2019t doing it, someone else would. But what I think we have a unique ability to do is we\u2019re really good at stopping things like bots because we do it every day. So again, it wasn\u2019t like we were sitting around being like, \u201cHey, what should we do next? Let\u2019s go change the business model of the web\u201d, it was our customers who were publishers were coming to us being like, \u201cWe\u2019re dying and we don\u2019t have the technical wherewithal to step in front of it, but we need to stop this, please help\u201d. And honestly, when Neil [Vogel] at Dotdash Meredith was telling me this, I rolled my eyes and I was like, \u201cPublishers, they\u2019re such Luddites, they\u2019re always complaining about the new technology, they\u2019re always complaining about the next thing, this isn\u2019t a big deal\u201d. And Neil and a bunch of others finally said, \u201cJust go pull the data\u201d, and it was only when we actually saw the data, when we saw that over the course of the last 10 years, it\u2019s become 10 times harder to get a click from Google for the same amount of content on that same kind of basis, it\u2019s now 750 times harder with OpenAI, it\u2019s 30,000 times harder with Anthropic. The business of traffic on the Internet as being the currency is going away and so something either again, either content creation is going to die, it\u2019s going to become futile, or we\u2019ve got to create a new business model. Again, if our mission is to help build a better Internet, this seems squarely in the line with what we should be working on. So why does Garry Tan say that you are an axis of evil with Browserbase and you should legalize AI agents? MP: I really don\u2019t understand. I mean, I\u2019m confused by Garry, I think part of it might be that he\u2019s an investor in Perplexity. Every story needs four characters, you need to have a victim, you need to have a villain, you need to have a hero, and you need to have the village idiot or the stooge. And if you think about it, any news story has those four characters. Right now, the people who have most been the villains have been Perplexity , where they\u2019re doing just actively nefarious things in order to try and get around content company. I\u2019ll give you an example of something that we\u2019ve seen them do, which is that if they\u2019re blocked from getting the content of an article, they\u2019ll actually, they\u2019ll query against services like Trade Desk, which is an ad serving service and Trade Desk will provide them the headline of the article and they\u2019ll provide them a rough description of what the article is about. They will take those two things and they will then make up the content of the article and publish it as if it was fact for, \u201cThis was published by this author at this time\u201d. So you can imagine if Perplexity couldn\u2019t get to Stratechery content, they would say, \u201cOh, Ben Thompson wrote about this\u201d, and then they would just make something up about it and they put your name along it. Forget copyright, that\u2019s fraud, just straight up and that\u2019s the sort of bad behavior of some tech companies that again, I think needs to be called out and punished. The Google Problem You go back to 2024 though, so I think, I don\u2019t remember if it was you or someone else calling out Perplexity for ignoring do not crawl things on websites, and people got really up in arms about it. My pushback at the time was , \u201cDo we want Google competition or not?\u201d, because what Google is doing is yes, OpenAI pioneered their own web bot and protocol and you can ask OpenAI to not crawl your website and they respect it. Google did the same, but the Google same one is Googlebot-extended, the actual Googlebot is like, \u201cWell, you want to be in search\u201d, and it turns out AI Overviews is governed by Googlebot. So why does Google get to do it and Perplexity can\u2019t? MP: I think we should have an open bet, and I\u2019ll take whatever bet you want. It can be a basketball game at some point. It can be whatever is is, that 12 months from now, will Google provide publishers a way of opting out of AI Overviews? And I\u2019ll say yes, and I think you\u2019ll say no. I don\u2019t know, I have to think about this, I\u2019m not committed, I\u2019m not committing yet. MP: Okay. But I agree, and you wrote about it, is Google is the problem. We were very careful when we did this. We actually blocked training, which is what they use Gemini for and so we can block that and we\u2019ve blocked that across the place. We have not blocked RAG, we\u2019ve not blocked search for anyone including Perplexity, even though they are doing naughty, naughty things. And by the way, OpenAI is evidence that you can do the right thing, you can be good actors and you can still have actually a better product as a result, and be a viable competitor to Google. So I think that Google will, and I am hopeful that they will, because they are a company that has really believed in the ecosystem, and they see what\u2019s happening in the ecosystem and they understand that if something doesn\u2019t change, that the ecosystem is going to suffer. I think that they will voluntarily give publishers a way out of AI Overviews within the next 12 months. I\u2019m actually optimistic it will happen faster than that and if they don\u2019t do it voluntarily, I know that there are a number of regulators that would be happy to force them to do it. Do you feel encouraged or discouraged by the Google case this week ? MP: Well, so first of all, it\u2019s like 280 pages long. It was really long, I was up until 5:00 AM, I had to read through the whole thing. MP: I\u2019ve read summaries and I\u2019ve had my team who are going through it. So I\u2019m not sure that forcing them to sell Chrome is the right remedy. No, I thought that it was dumb. I think the big thing is, my whole thing with Google is they\u2019ve basically paid off everyone , and then the justification for allowing them to continue payments is that everyone\u2019s dependent on Google payments. It\u2019s like this circular justification, which isn\u2019t wrong, but that\u2019s basically the nut of it. MP: Again, I\u2019m not an expert on the \u2014 as we\u2019re recording this, that came out yesterday, and so I\u2019m not an expert on it yet \u2014 the thing that worries me the most is that some of what the judge suggested was that Google had to share data with the rest of the ecosystem, and so a horrible outcome for this that will actually destroy the ecosystem, and the most depressing sentence in the ruling that I\u2019ve seen so far was the one that was like, \u201cIt seems like this might have bad impacts on the publishing industry, but not a single publisher testified\u201d, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh guys, you got to get on the field if you\u2019re going to win the game\u201d. So I do think that regardless of what Cloudflare is doing, the economics of the Internet are changing, they\u2019re changing because there is a better interface that is coming along that is being provided by a lot of people including Google and if the ecosystem is going to thrive and survive, we have to change the economics of the compensation to content creators. We can do that in a way which I think is very reasonable, and my prediction will be that over time, AI companies will look more like YouTube or Netflix, where they compete on what original content they have access to as opposed to the algorithms. We already see the algorithms are largely commodities, they\u2019re leapfrogging each other all the time, I think that\u2019s going to continue for quite some time. I am in the there will be thousands of different AI interfaces we\u2019ll pay for or they\u2019ll be ad supported in various ways, but what will cause you to choose one versus the other is whether or not they have access to whatever it is that you particularly care about. I do think, by the way, I think I agree with your bet just because the core Google strategy that paid off massively in this case is basically paying everyone off. MP: That\u2019s right. So that\u2019s why this is a scheme to pay everyone off. MP: Exactly. Now I think it\u2019s really important \u2014 so again, I don\u2019t know exactly what this is \u2014 but we have to make sure that whatever the payment scheme is that it takes into account that if you\u2019re smaller, you pay less, and if you\u2019re bigger, you pay more. So again, my straw man on this is $1 per year per MAU, and you pay it into a pool and then how we distribute it out to the content creators, that\u2019s a whole other can of worms. Potentially a very profitable can of worms if someone can sit in the middle and be the market maker. MP: Potentially. Could that be Cloudflare? MP: Whether we\u2019re that or not, again, if it\u2019s profitable, there\u2019ll be a lot of people that will be competing to do that and if we can add value, then we\u2019ll capture some of the value. But I think that the most important thing is how do we figure out some way where the vast majority of that is actually going to the people that are doing the work of creating content? And ideally, do it in a way where what we\u2019re rewarding is not who is rage baiting people, but who is actually filling in human knowledge. Cloudflare\u2019s Motivation I wrote this a few months ago , you know we\u2019re on the same page, it\u2019s just what\u2019s striking about you doing this is like, well, maybe someone has to actually break some eggs to make it happen. MP: Of course. But this leads to my final question that ties together when we talked about content moderation and now we\u2019re talking about this, is there a dichotomy between the power you\u2019re seeking to leverage to push through this new standard for content, and then the power you claim to not want when it comes to content moderation? \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be involved\u201d, well, do you want to have power or do you not? MP: We still want to stop when cyber attacks are coming. That\u2019s where we built a fairly valuable business in having the power of doing that. I think where we get nervous is in saying, is this content good or bad? And so for instance, I think that the right way to figure out who gets paid as content providers is not Cloudflare coming up with an algorithm that says, \u201cThis is important content, you should have it and this is unimportant content, you shouldn\u2019t\u201d. Each AI company should come up with their own algorithm and be able to plug it into, whether it\u2019s our system or our competitors, whoever it is, and say, \u201cHere\u2019s our system, you see content, rank it for us based on our algorithm and OpenAI\u2019s rank will be different than Anthropic\u2019s, will be different than Perplexity\u2019s\u201d. You should have that ability and that ranking should I think be scored on two different axis, which is how reputable is this, and then how novel is it? How much does it actually further that? If you do that correctly and you have a real variety of different \u2014 if you have tons of different AI companies and you have tons of different content creators, then again, I think sure, we\u2019re playing the role of being the technical facilitator there, but the actual decisions on what content matters and doesn\u2019t, that still is something that, again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right place for us to be making those decisions. You want to be a market maker, not a picker. MP: We\u2019re not an editor. That\u2019s the word. MP: Yeah. Again, I think the one thing that we are very good at right now is creating scarcity and every market depends on that. Whether we or someone else then figures out how to monetize that scarcity, it\u2019s fine and by the way, I think the vast majority of this will be large publishers doing direct deals with large AI companies. But that sucks for all the small guys. MP: That\u2019s where again, we can be kind of a piece of it where we say, \u201cOkay, we now on behalf of the small guys, let\u2019s work with you to figure out how you can participate in this market as well\u201d. Small guys on both sides \u2014 small AI companies, startups. We have to make sure that as we design this, that it\u2019s working in this way, and then small content creators. I guess my ask would be, since you have a relatively influential list, if you\u2019re an academic and you\u2019re reading Ben\u2019s stuff and you think that this is really interesting, the reason Google ended up figuring this out, and I think being a great force of good in the world, Google did a lot of good in the world. The reason they did that is they thought very carefully about how these market dynamics are and so we\u2019re trying to work with the leading academic economists and market theoricians to figure out, \u201cHow should this market look like going forward?\u201d, and so reach out if you\u2019re reading this because we\u2019d love to talk to you about it. We spent a lot of time at the beginning \u2014 we\u2019ve gone a little long, I appreciate you sticking on \u2014 talking about your background and how you got to where you were, it\u2019s really interesting. It\u2019s not the traditional tech path, is that actually integral to this final topic? If you are just a traditional, came up through computers, went to Stanford, started a company, would you be picking this fight, or is this downstream from teaching out of law school that doesn\u2019t even exist anymore, just to get away from Hooters? MP: Just to get away from running my dad\u2019s Hooters. I don\u2019t know. I think that the most valuable \u2014 so I have an English major, I have a computer science minor, I\u2019ve got a law degree, I\u2019ve got a business school degree, there were lots of times where I thought those three years at law school where completely wasted. It is incredibly valuable. I can sit and read the Google judge\u2019s ruling and understand what\u2019s important and what\u2019s not in that, those things have been incredibly important. I think that the ability to speak and write and communicate and appreciate how much work creating great content is, I think that that\u2019s been really helpful. I think I\u2019ve tried, when we\u2019ve talked about content moderation in the past, we struggle with those issues and struggle with what the right thing to do is. It went back to what side of the bed did you wake up on, right? MP: Yeah, totally. (laughing) That\u2019s a reference for people that don\u2019t remember previous controversies. MP: How angry your girlfriend at the time, wife now, is at you at that particular moment. But going back and literally reading Aristotle, I think that that\u2019s great. And so today I get invited, there\u2019s a handful of AI companies that have invited me to be on their board and things, and I always say no. But I talk to them and I must be one of the top non-academic buyers of Aristotle\u2019s Politics , because almost every AI CEO has gotten a signed copy from me saying, \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is incredibly important, but you\u2019ve got to think about the ethics and how to create trust\u201d. I do think that, I hope that the people that are building these incredible systems that are going to be incredibly transformative, that they do spend some time in the liberal arts, that they do spend some time actually stopping and reading and thinking about like, \u201cOkay, if we\u2019re successful\u201d \u2014 I think there\u2019s been a lot of, \u201cIf we\u2019re successful, it\u2019s some version of James Cameron and Terminator\u201d. But I think there\u2019s another version which is, \u201cOkay, if we build these powerful systems, how do we make sure that they\u2019re trustworthy over time?\u201d, and those are issues that people have struggled with for a long time and I feel very lucky to have gotten the time to sit and think about them and I do think that that\u2019s been helpful and instructive to the company that Cloudflare is today. Well, I feel happy and lucky to have had your time in this interview. Thanks for coming on. MP: Ben, thanks for having me. This Daily Update Interview is also available as a podcast.

If our little design podcast were a person, it would be old enough to have a provisional driver\u2019s license in some states or celebrate a quincea\u00f1era. Since we first launched on September 3rd, 2010, we\u2019ve spent 15 years telling stories about design, architecture, and the choices we make that shape our world. That\u2019s 15 years of taking the time to stop and read the plaque, and 15 years of you, our incredible listeners, sending us the most amazing observations about the built environment that we never would have noticed on our own. To celebrate this milestone, we decided to do something a little different. Instead of our usual deep dive into one particular design story, Roman Mars is answering 15 eclectic questions submitted by listeners and staff \u2013 questions about the show, about design, and about Roman himself. This anniversary episode offers a behind-the-scenes look at the stories and people that have made 99% Invisible what it is today. It\u2019s our way of celebrating all the invisible things that have become a little more visible over the past decade and a half. Enjoy 99pi?

READER COMMENTS LEAVE A COMMENT READ COMMENT POLICY Luke J Sep 1 2025 at 4:50pm Reply As I was walking my dog yesterday, I was reflecting on the [presumed] fact that his inner life is similar to A.I. in that neither aspires to be anything other than what they are.\u00a0 I might be wrong on both. Matt Ball Sep 2 2025 at 10:35am Reply I really expected to love this episode. To many people, I seem to be an \u201canimal rights activist\u201d because I want to curb (and eventually stop) the worst factory farming cruelties. And I do think quite a bit of suffering stems from the idea that humans are \u201csuperior,\u201d and thus other sentient beings have no ethical relevance (unless we personally value them, like dogs and cats). But Dr. Webb seems to have what I consider to be the liberal romantic problem: 1. Thinking \u201cnature\u201d is great. It isn\u2019t. 2. Thinking \u201cnatural\u201d is to be strived for. It isn\u2019t. \u201cNatural\u201d is dying before you turn five, and if you live beyond that, dying in childbirth. Etc. 3. Thinking that the world is in \u201ccrisis.\u201d This is no more true than in the past, and by almost every measure \u2013 for humans \u2013 it is not true. By basically every measure, there has never been a better time to be the median human \u2013 lifespan, material well-being, etc. Of course, if you look at the number of non-humans being factory farmed, which is even worse than being \u201cwild,\u201d I think that numerically, it has never been a worse time to be the median non-human animal. Many things are bad. Most (human) things were worse. Things could be much better for all sentient beings. I appreciate how gentle and kind Russ was in pushing back. Christine Webb Sep 2 2025 at 2:51pm Reply Thank you so much for listening, and even more for your animal rights advocacy. I think we can agree on some key points\u2014especially that factory farming represents an unparalleled scale of suffering, and that human exceptionalism is deeply problematic. Here are a few thoughts in response to your points about the liberal romantic problem. If by \u201cnature\u201d we mean the more-than-human world (humans included), I do think it\u2019s great in the sense of wondrous, complex, and worth respecting. That doesn\u2019t mean I see it as all harmony and cooperation. In the book, I push back against both extremes: the overly rosy picture of nature as endlessly cooperative and the equally misleading \u201cred in tooth and claw\u201d view of nature as only violent and selfish. I try to show instead how cooperation and competition are deeply intertwined\u2014each makes the other possible. I also want to be clear that I don\u2019t endorse the naturalistic fallacy. Saying something is \u201cnatural\u201d doesn\u2019t mean I think it should be idealized or pursued. What interests me is how humans define and deploy \u201cnature\u201d in different contexts\u2014and how those definitions shape our treatment of other beings. On the question of whether the world is really \u201cin crisis\u201d: Perhaps for the median human today, many indicators look better\u2014life expectancy, material security, education. But I\u2019m curious what you make of critiques like this article, which argue that those metrics obscure the bigger picture. Much of that \u201cprogress\u201d has depended on ecological devastation, mass displacement, and accelerating climate instability. In other words, is it truly \u201cbetter\u201d if the conditions that made it possible are unsustainable and are driving immense harm to both human and nonhuman communities \u2014 past, present and future? Rob W Sep 2 2025 at 3:16pm Reply Webb makes valuable points about how we\u2019ve underestimated animal cognition and sentience, and how our testing methods have been biased in embarrassing ways. But her more ambitious claims stumble on a fundamental definitional problem. She states \u201cthe definition of intelligence that many scientists in animal cognition and related fields use is the capacity to solve novel problems in one\u2019s environment.\u201d But this definition is not widely used because it produces plainly nonsensical results. By this standard, you couldn\u2019t say whether Einstein was more intelligent than bacteria thriving in their ecological niche \u2013 after all, the bacteria successfully solve all the problems in their environment. A human would be deemed intelligent on land but unintelligent underwater or at high altitude, since those aren\u2019t \u201cour\u201d environment. This clearly isn\u2019t what anyone means by intelligence. What Webb is actually describing is more like ecological fitness \u2013 how well-adapted an organism is to its specific niche. Yes, moss has thrived for hundreds of millions of years, but that makes it well-adapted, not intelligent. Conflating these concepts obscures rather than clarifies. A definition that better captures what we mean by intelligence would be: the ability to solve problems across a wide variety of circumstances, especially ones you didn\u2019t evolve for. This is where human cognition genuinely stands out. We don\u2019t just survive in the African savanna where we evolved \u2013 we thrive in the Arctic, in deserts, underwater, even in space. We achieve this through abstract reasoning, cumulative cultural knowledge, and technology that lets us transcend our biological limitations. Webb\u2019s own examples inadvertently prove this point. She celebrates researchers like Len Howard who revolutionized our understanding of bird cognition. But this meta-cognitive ability \u2013 studying how other species think, developing better methodologies, recognizing our own biases \u2013 is itself a uniquely human form of intelligence. No baboon is writing papers about human theory of mind. Her climate change argument particularly misses the mark. She suggests our failure to solve climate change shows we\u2019re not intelligent. But we identified this incredibly complex, long-term, global phenomenon precisely through our intelligence \u2013 something no other species could do. Our struggle isn\u2019t comprehension but coordination among billions of individuals with competing interests. That\u2019s a political problem, not an intelligence deficit. Webb makes valuable points about how we\u2019ve systematically underestimated animal cognition and designed biased experiments. Animals are far more capable than we\u2019ve historically acknowledged. But respecting their remarkable abilities doesn\u2019t require adopting definitions that make \u201cintelligence\u201d meaningless. We can recognize both that animals have rich cognitive lives AND that human abstract reasoning represents something genuinely distinctive in nature which is having enormous effects on the world. Christine Webb Sep 4 2025 at 10:58am Reply Thank you for taking the time to engage so thoughtfully with these ideas. The general definition I offer here\u2014intelligence as the capacity to solve * novel* problems in one\u2019s environment\u2014isn\u2019t so different from what you suggest. Novelty, by definition, goes beyond routine ecological \u201cfitness\u201d and requires flexibility in thinking and behavior. Many animals, from corvids to primates, demonstrate this kind of problem-solving across circumstances they didn\u2019t evolve for. The challenge you point to\u2014that definitions quickly become slippery or \u201cnonsensical\u201d\u2014is why in the book I try to move away from single/standard definitions of intelligence. When we treat \u201cintelligence\u201d as a single, universally agreed-upon faculty, we overlook marked cultural variation in how it\u2019s defined, and we risk privileging human criteria by default (abstract reasoning, cumulative culture, technology). But there are so many other forms of intelligence (e.g., emotional or spatial intelligence, to name just a couple). That said, I have no problem with the idea that humans have unique capacities! Or capacities they excel at compared to other species. And I agree that no baboon is writing papers about theory of mind, or landing themselves on the moon. I just don\u2019t think that those differences should necessarily create different moral privileges. That is why human exceptionalism is different from human uniqueness. Perhaps the ability to solve problems across a wide variety of circumstances is one of those differences, as you said. Or studying minds in a particular way (as you mentioned re: Len Howard). But observing minds (as they manifest in behavior, as Howard did) and inferring the perceptions, intentions, and knowledge of others is not uniquely human. In Howard\u2019s book, it\u2019s clear the birds she lived with did it right back to her\u2014and that is how they established a trusting relationship. On climate change, I don\u2019t mean to deny the extraordinary intelligence involved in identifying the problem. But I do think it\u2019s fair to ask what kind of intelligence continually generates existential threats it cannot coordinate to solve. Other species display forms of intelligence that are profound in their own right, and I think we learn more when we expand rather than narrow the frame of what we consider genuinely intelligent.

Merwin\u2019s translation: A man worn down by time, A man who does not even expect death (the proofs of death are statistics and everyone runs the risk of being the first immortal)\u2026 Second, Scott Alexander published a wonderful and funny dialogue on his Substack Astral Codex Ten this morning called What is Man, That Thou Art Mindful of Him? , which resonates nicely with this particular episode of EconTalk. In this dialogue, God himself is taken to task over the shortcomings of \u201cBI\u201d (\u201cbiological intelligence\u201d) in terms that mirror the common criticisms of AI. I think you would enjoy it. Shalom Freedman Sep 3 2025 at 8:58am Reply Humans are the best and the worst. The attempts by those who study other animal species to show that they are in the same league as humans, ignore the vast powers humans alone possess. Communication in complex language, abstract reasoning, cooperation in large-scale enterprises of all kinds, the power to scientifically explore reality, are just a few of the unique human powers. Of course, one can make a long list of evils only humans are capable of and are guilty of now. One other obvious point is that no other creature can even begin to understand itself or other creatures as humans can. neil21 Sep 3 2025 at 4:43pm Reply Reminded me of this quote from Merlin \u201cthe mushroom man\u201d Sheldrake: https://bsky.app/profile/neil21.bsky.social/post/3lul25f7mw224 >>> We are fundamentally interconnected beings. The air we breathe in and breathe out, the water and molecules that flow through our body, continually reconstitute our actual bodies. We have countless organisms that live in and on us, without which we cannot do what we do or behave as we behave. Then there\u2019s how we relate to other humans and animals-the way pets in hospitals soothe people and help them recover from illness, simply through their emotional presence. Humans too: loneliness is a cripplingly dangerous epidemic. All these different levels in which we need others, are constituted by others. We forget this when we\u2019re socialized into individualism, when we think of ourselves as neatly bound autonomous units \u2013 which is simply not true on a biological level, nor on a social level. This illusion helps us justify social and ecological devastation. So when we think about rising to the challenges that come through such devastation, part of what we must address is how we conceive of our relationships, both with each other and the living world more generally. Greg McIsaac Sep 16 2025 at 12:15am Reply Daniel Kahneman and his collaborators talked about fast and slow modes of thinking by humans. Fast thinking is more reactive and gut based, while slow thinking is more reflective and abstract. I think there is evidence that humans share some aspects of fast thinking with animals. And some animals show signs of slow thinking ability in using tools and solving puzzles.  I think the reason humans have become the dominant species is not primarily due to individual thinking ability, but largely thanks to cumulative collective abilities. Through art and writing we can record events so that subsequent generations might build on prior achievements and maybe learn from past mistakes.  There may be a similar learning process in other species that occurs genetically. Individual animals with genes that code for fast thinking guiding successful mating and migration behaviors pass down genes that produce similar behavioral impulses in their offspring. These behaviors certainly appear to be forms of thinking akin to fast human thinking and sometimes slow thinking such as in long distance migration.  But this genetic learning seems to result in slower variation and adaptation than what humans have achieved through cultural variation and adaptation. Few if any humans know how to make a pencil or a computer.  But many of us know how to use pencils and computers and can build on what our ancestors have accomplished. Other species may do something similar, but those changes seem to occur and accumulate much more slowly and less dramatically. Do humans deserve special status for having accomplished faster and more dramatic adaptations?  Or is our adaptive ability more of an emergent property from being created with opposable thumbs and brains somewhat more capable of abstract thinking than other species?  Since we are the creatures writing down who gets credit, I suspect we will be biased toward giving ourselves extra credit. Michael L Jackson Sep 17 2025 at 10:42am Reply I don\u2019t think the question is our intelligence relative to other species; as Webb points out, our intelligence might ensure our dominance, but it doesn\u2019t ensure our longevity.\u00a0 I think the uniqueness of our species, as brought up in The Dawn of Everything, is that we are the most political animals.\u00a0 In other words, we are unique in the variation with which we organize our societies, and our ability to reshape and restructure them.\u00a0 There may be slight variations in the shape and structure of chimpanzees and other great apes societies, but nothing on the level of what\u2019s existed in human history.\u00a0 And that uniqueness means, as Webb implies, that we might\u00a0 create a society whose hierarchy (gov\u2019t, institutions, etc.) pursues its own eventual destruction through unsustainable forms of subsistence. This would also explain why there are social movements to, say, stop taking vaccines which are hugely responsible for that surge in wealth and well-being that Russ describes.\u00a0 Or, why we insist on using sources of energy that will eventually be depleted, rather than investing in more long-term, inexhaustible ones\u2026.abundant energy also being a major factor in that material success of the last 250 years. In other words, our scientific progress means absolutely nothing if we ignore its benefits and applications.\u00a0 So intelligence itself is a very poor metric for judging our species, and that of others.

AUDIO TRANSCRIPT Time Podcast Episode Highlights 0:37 Intro. [Recording date: July 27, 2025.] Russ Roberts: Today is July 27th, 2025, and my guest is primatologist and author Christine Webb, of New York University. She's the author of The Arrogant Ape: The Myth of Human Exceptionalism and Why It Matters , which is our topic for today. Christine, welcome to EconTalk. Christine Webb: Thanks so much for having me. 0:56 Russ Roberts: Why do you call human beings arrogant apes? Christine Webb: So, the arrogant ape is a catchy phrase, I think. There's alliteration there. So, there was a strategic move in making that the title. But, the arrogant ape does not refer to all human beings. It doesn't even refer necessarily to a particular group of human beings, a particular culture, nor does it refer to an individual. For me, the arrogant ape represents a character, and I was inspired by the concept of hubris in Greek tragedy, this sort of arrogance that leads protagonists to their downfall, but they're often unaware that they even hold this arrogant worldview. And so, the arrogant ape is sort of this mask, this character, I think, that many humans inherit or don as a result of a worldview that sometimes they're not even aware that they have. Russ Roberts: And, what price do we pay for that arrogance? Christine Webb: Well, I would argue that arrogance is at the root of the ecological crisis. And, I say 'at the root' and not 'the root of,' because I think the root of the ecological crisis is complicated, and I think like root systems, there's many interlinked causes. But I think human exceptionalism is a big one. Russ Roberts: Why? Christine Webb: I think that when we believe that we are separate from and superior to the rest of life on earth, it leads us to treat other beings and their environments as mere resources or objects to be exploited. It doesn't make us feel connected to them, a part of them. It doesn't make us feel like our well-being depends on the well-being of the rest of the living world. So, placing ourselves outside of that world is part of what allows us to exploit it with abandon. 2:52 Russ Roberts: I'm open to that possibility that how we treat the world reflects our cultural baggage, inheritance, legacy, and so on. But, what I found most interesting about the book is the impact of our arrogance on our ability to understand the world as opposed to how we treat it. And, I thought you were very persuasive. I'm a bit of a skeptic about your fundamental thesis, but you made some headway with me, and that was because you really chronicle a lot of the different ways that human beings as scientists by putting themselves at the center of things--excuse me, not at the center, at the top of things, the arrogance part--have handicapped our ability to understand the natural world. So, talk about that a little bit. Christine Webb: Yeah, so I suppose that would be a second answer to your question, that another way in which this worldview really comes back to hurt us and haunt us is that it limits our science. And, in the book I talk a lot about doing more ethical science that takes seriously the perspectives and the interests of the beings we're working with and that we're studying, and how that is not only more permissible from an ethical point of view, but therefore leads to richer science. So, one of the examples that I always give has to do with research in comparative cognition, which is essentially where we're comparing the cognitive abilities of species. Typically, these studies look at the cognitive abilities of humans compared to our closest living primate relatives--chimpanzees or bonobos. Those kinds of cognitive comparisons are often biased from the start for a number of reasons. For one, they're typically comparing the abilities of chimpanzees who live in highly restricted man-made environments like labs or zoos. These chimpanzees have often been separated from their biological mothers at birth. They're separated from the group during testing protocols. They're tested on human tasks like plastic puzzles and computer touch screens. The human samples in these studies are typically fully autonomous Western humans. We often call them WEIRD humans. We've heard of this acronym before. WEIRD stands for Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich Democrats. And that's the subset of humankind that figures most prominently in psychology research; but they're highly unrepresentative of humanity on the whole, right? So, the human samples are also highly unrepresentative of humans on the whole, just like the chimpanzee samples are highly unrepresentative of their sort of wild or natural counterparts. And so, the humans--maybe they're children--they come into the lab just for the day. At the end of the experiment, they return to their natural homes, often living with their families. During the study they're often sitting on their parents' lap, right? They're in a very comfortable position. They're tested with other humans, on human tasks, with human materials. And then, sometimes these studies will conclude that humans are superior on a particular cognitive ability or social tendency, like [?] sociality, cooperation, altruism. But of course, the deck is stacked against them, right? This is not a valid comparison, and this is really an unscientific comparison. No one would think it's appropriate to study humans living in that environment and take them as the benchmark for human cognition, let's say in prisons. That would be the equivalent. So, it's striking to me that this is acceptable in science. And then, the question is, 'Okay, well why would we accept this in science?' And, I think the assumption is that those difficult environments, those deprived environments, don't harm the chimpanzees as much as they would the humans. Otherwise, how is this a valid comparison? And, I think that assumption, that environments don't matter as much for other beings as they do for our own development and well-being, is a problematic one, right? And, it's a very human-centric one. Russ Roberts: Yeah, I really like the idea, the choice of task. We do tend to pick tasks that we're really good at. I don't view it as quite as sinister as you might, but I think the right analogy might be if--you know, Americans and Europeans both play football, but they mean something very different by football. So, if you invite a great European football team to play American football, they're going to get crushed. And vice versa: if a European team invited an American football team to play European football, they'd be crushed. And it wouldn't tell you much about anything actually because they're kind of orthogonal to each other. 8:14 Russ Roberts: And, talk about some examples from the animal world, or animals either that you've witnessed or have read about, and then written about, achieve some impressive cognitive feats. Christine Webb: Yeah. So, one of the most amazing encounters I ever had with another animal happened in the desert, was with a Chacma baboon, a desert-adapted Chacma baboon. His name is Bear. And, he was a juvenile at the time, causing quite the ruckus within his social group, but also amongst the human researchers. He was kind of always challenging us and prodding us and getting our attention, climbing on people. It wasn't the best situation, as you can imagine. And, one day I was in the field with a colleague. There were always two people in the field following a particular troop of baboons. And, things got more intense and scary than they had in previous altercations with Bear. So, Bear and a bunch of other baboons surrounded her[?another baboon?], and they started slapping her legs and vocalizing. And, it was just a very tense moment that could have escalated into something much worse. Fortunately, she wasn't hurt that bad. She just had some scratches on her legs, but it didn't escalate into a full-on aggressive conflict. Anyways, she was terrified. I was terrified. It was a horrible experience. And, we were even questioning after that incident whether we should continue to follow this troop, whether it was safe. So, the next day I'm following the same troop again, but at a much greater distance. And, over the ridge marches Bear and his entourage yet again. And, this time they're making a beeline for me . And, I was in this very awkward position, sort of wobbling down this very steep rocky incline. And I could not easily get out of their way, and I didn't want to have a sudden movement or act scared at all. I wanted to act calm and measured. And so, on the surface, I really did remain calm. But, inside I was panicking. I was really, really scared. And as Bear continued to approach, he came right up to me. He put his hand in between my legs, and he looked up at me, and he bared his teeth into this incredibly forced grimace, this like baring all of his teeth and smiling at me in a way. But, as a primatologist, I know that this kind of bare teeth display is a pacifying gesture. It's something baboons do to appease one another and to ease tensions. Right? And so, in that moment, Bear was trying to show his benign intent. He was signaling to me that, 'Okay, I'm not going to do something bad.' And, it was an incredible moment for me because a baboon had never done this to me. I've never heard of a baboon doing this to other researchers, although it may well have happened before. And, I was really trying to make sense of: 'Okay, what was Bear doing?' He was such a terror always. So, why would he do this? And, the most parsimonious explanation I kept returning to was that Bear knew what I knew. Bear knew that I had witnessed what had happened the day before. And, he was trying to make amends. He was trying to say, 'That's not going to happen today. That's not going to happen to you.' And, scientists have a proper name for this ability to know what I was thinking and feeling, which is theory of mind. It's the capacity to know and understand what others are thinking. And, I learned as a graduate student that humans were unique in their capacity for theory of mind: that we alone can know what another human is thinking or feeling. And not only did Bear show that ability, but he showed it for a member of another species , which was astounding to me. So, that really challenged my assumptions about what separates humans from other animals, and much of what I had been taught as the sort of cognitive markers of human uniqueness. And, I have many examples like that, but it often is from the animals themselves revealing something, showing me something in a moment of trust and surprise. 12:54 Russ Roberts: So, I really learned a lot from the book about animals; and a small part of the book is about plants also, their capabilities. And, you do challenge the idea in many examples, like the one you just did, that man is the only animal that, fill-in-the-blank. Human beings are the only creatures that, fill-in-the-blank. And maybe at the end we'll talk about some of the ones that crossed my mind, but you didn't write about. But, having said that, I do feel like human beings are the dominant, or at the top, which you are very much an opponent of in this book. And, you point out, just as an example, you say, quote: We're not the biggest, fastest, or strongest. Blue whales, cheetahs, and rhinoceros beetles outdo us there. Nor are we the most numerous or long-lived: ants and sea sponges, not to mention most bacteria and plant species, easily have us beat there, too. Other species outperform humans in countless ways. Just try competing with eagles on vision tests, or dolphins on tests of echolocation. So, we turn to our intellect. It was decided we must have the edge there, too. End of quote. Now, I think we do have the edge on intellect. It's true that we have--what I learned from your book is we've probably grossly underestimated the capabilities of all kinds of species to do all kinds of things that we thought we were really phenomenal at: communication, reasoning, the use of tools, and so on. But, we are really good at this thinking thing. I think we're the only animal that has abstract thought. We're the only animal that writes books like this, like The Arrogant Ape. You couldn't imagine an ape complaining about their place in the scientific or physical world and publishing a book that tried to set the record straight. Only an arrogant ape like yourself would be capable of it. So, to some extent--well, I'll say it differently. You opened my eyes to a lot of things, that makes the book extremely interesting. But, have you gone too far? And, let me just add one more thing. We honor, ourselves--the best among ourselves--often using intellect, for better or for worse. It is the criterion we tend to use to judge each other, at least in 2025. In 1730, it might have been physical strength or physical speed. And, in certain athletic contests, that's still important. But, intellect is how we rank ourselves, more or less. Understanding, of course, there's something foolish about it. Intellect is not one-dimensional. Even IQ [Intelligence Quotient] is not a very good measure of how smart people are. But, do you think you've gone too far? Christine Webb: So, these are great questions, and I appreciate--I mean, this reminds me of conversations that we would have in the classroom a lot. Where there was always at least one student who would have your perspective, and it made for a better conversation every week. And, so, first of all, I think it depends on how we define intellect or intelligence. Right? There's so many different ways of defining intelligence. We talk about emotional quotients now, right? Emotional intelligence. There's spatial intelligence. There's what we would formally call IQ, intelligence quotients. There's creativity, there's abstract reasoning. There's so many different kinds of intelligence. And so, how are we defining intelligence? And maybe on some measures or some definitions of intelligence, humans do excel compared to other species. But I would argue that other species excel on other metrics of intelligence. And, perhaps most fundamentally, the definition of intelligence that many scientists in animal cognition and related fields use is the capacity to solve novel problems in one's environment. And when I think about what we're doing today, there we have a problem in our environment called the climate crisis, and we have solutions, but we're not enacting them. So, we're not actually solving anything. In many cases, we're making it worse. And so, under that very basic definition of intelligence, I have a hard time believing, particularly at the current ecological moment when we are in a fraught relationship with our environment that is begging for alternative solutions and actions, and they're not getting implemented. So, I have a very hard time with the notion that humans are the most intelligent species under that definition alone. But, to your point about taking it too far, one of the mistakes that I made in the beginning of thinking about these ideas was to assume that everything that humans do, other species can do in some way, shape, or form. And, I don't believe that anymore. I am not going to argue that a gorilla is out there contemplating what book he's going to write about and then doing it. Right? I think that humans are unique, and I think that all species are unique, and I think we should honor that uniqueness. And so, I do think it can be taken too far to assume that we're all the same or we're all so similar. I think humans have unique things about them, just like I think dragonflies have unique things about them that make them interesting and worthy of moral concern in their own right. 18:47 Russ Roberts: Yeah, I think that moral concern is powerful, and I accept the critique that--it's one of the themes of the book, that our treatment of the natural world stems from our feelings of superiority. And, I think that's undeniably true. And, I think your book makes one challenge that presumption. And, I love the idea that all species are unique. I don't think that climate change is an example of our stupidity. I don't think the problem--in fact, you could argue it's the opposite: that the problem with climate change and our impact on the environment through the production of carbon is because of our skill at pulling carbon out of the ground and using it to do extraordinary things that bring great pleasure to people. So, it's hard to give that up. I don't think that's irrational. I think it's an incentive problem of collective action, a problem of politics. Now, I don't know if animals do collectively foolish things, over-consume a resource. I could imagine that they might struggle to look ahead to the future as well. But, I'm curious for your thoughts on that? Christine Webb: Yeah, I mean, I'm thinking about this double-edged sword idea that Justin Gregg writes about. There's a book called If Nietzsche Were a Narwhal. He wrote this book that kind of deals with the trade-offs that are involved in human intelligence, which I think is what you're pointing to, that our extractive capabilities are in some ways a sign of our superior intelligence, right? And, I don't completely disagree with that, but I would also agree that a sign of intelligence would be the ability to live in sustainable relation with the rest of nature. And, we're not doing that , right? So, I think that there are trade-offs to all different forms of intelligence. There's a tendency in evolutionary biology to confound evolutionary success with ecological dominance. So, when people talk about humans being the most evolutionarily successful species on earth because they've managed to spread all over the earth and inhabit all of these different environments, that's one way of defining evolutionary success for sure. But, another way of defining evolutionary success, which Robin Wall Kimmerer does in her work and her writing on mosses, would be the ability to sustain thriving interspecies communities. I mean, mosses have been around for hundreds of millions of years, hundreds of millions of years compared to humans' 200,000. And so, what if we measured evolutionary success, or defined evolutionary success, not as ecological dominance but as sustainability, as longevity over many, many generations. And then, we would maybe consider that ability to live in balance with those around us a measure of evolutionary success. Russ Roberts: We might be in trouble on that, our longevity. This is where we are, I think, much more capable of destroying ourselves than most species are. I think, by the way--the 'we've spread to every corner of the globe' and so on--I think the hubris of the human race, the species, is that we've figured out stuff we didn't know before. And that's an aspect of our success that I think other species can't match. Now, it's not a competition. The whole thing is kind of foolish. But, the fact that human beings live somewhat comfortably around the center of the earth in the state of nature and not so well at the poles is something we've overcome. We can live in the poles. It's not easy, but we're good at that. It's true that most animals are faster than humans, but we've figured out a way to fly faster and move faster with cars, and airplanes, and rockets. I mean, I think one of the most remarkable parts of the human experience is its dynamism; and other species, as far as I know, don't do that. For what it's worth, I'm not going to--again, I don't think there's this right to eat them. I'm a meat eater. I'm not proud of it. I think it's a problematic viewpoint, I mean a problematic lifestyle. But, I think the ability of humans to make progress is something to celebrate. But, it certainly doesn't give us the right to abuse animals or the environment. Christine Webb: I think, yeah, we certainly agree that we should not use those--whatever--metrics that we're using to call progress, as justification for exploitation. But, I would just say that, I would add that in gaining a certain kind of knowledge, do we lose another kind of knowledge? So, for instance, we might, I don't know, be good at, in let's say countries like the United States, developing technologies like cars, and airplanes, and rockets. But, what kind of knowledge have we lost? I mean, there's these stats about how kids and adults can recognize hundreds of corporate logos, but they can't tell you 10 species living in their local community? I mean, I think that that in and of itself, that's a form of sophisticated knowledge that's not in any way less important, or interesting, or sophisticated. It is a different form of knowledge. But, I think, yes, we might have gained a lot of knowledge, but we've also lost certain kinds of knowledge. And, I think that a lot of that knowledge is forever lost. Some of that knowledge is being protected and modeled by certain human communities who are still alive today, which is--coming back to this arrogant ape: who is the arrogant ape? I don't think it's all of humankind, nor do I think it's even a particular culture necessarily. I think it's kind of this way of acting, and moving, and being in the world, and that it's not necessarily true that an individual is an arrogant ape for their entire lives. People change. So, yeah, just to make the point that the arrogant ape is not all of humankind; and I think it's really important to acknowledge that, because of course, those humans who are the most at risk of the worst consequences of the ecological crisis are often the ones who are the least responsible for causing it in the first place. And so, there's just so much diverse experience across humans on many of the things we're talking about. 26:50 Russ Roberts: Yeah. I don't think knowledge of the natural world is lost . I think it's not accessed by most, by many Western wealthy people. They are estranged--we are estranged--from nature to a large extent. But I don't think that knowledge is lost. And I think, to a large extent--I mean, it's an interesting question; you might disagree with me--but I think a lot of the arrogance of--well, just call it Western civilization for now, the arrogance of Western civilization--helped create many of the things that we understand about the world, including medicine, including science. And, you could argue there's a trade-off: that we would be better off living more in harmony with nature without some of the things we've discovered through the relentless applications, say, of the scientific method. I think about Sebastian Junger's book, Tribe. On this program he talked about how, in colonial American times, people who were kidnapped by Native Americans often didn't want to come home after a while because they found themselves having a more communal life that they valued, a life closer to nature, and they found many rewards to a less material lifestyle. And, I think that's always been true in human experience. There's a certain romance about that, but some of that romance is well-earned. We'll talk maybe a little later about the feeling of belonging, and certainly less advanced civilizations: peoples, nations, have compensation in the fact--less advanced, meaning materially less advanced--are often more advanced in their connection to the earth or their connection to each other. And so, I don't want to minimize that. At the same time, I wouldn't want to romanticize some of the challenges of what we might call indigenous life, which is often nasty, brutish, and short, and hard, very hard, whereas-- Christine Webb: Because of the conditions in which they live, or because of ethnic and racial oppression-- Russ Roberts: No, the conditions in which they live. The challenges of getting enough calories to live beyond the age of five if you're a child, to survive childbirth if you're a woman, to repair yourself after an accident. Things that are effortlessly done in Western civilization and modern societies. I think protein--collecting enough protein to get through the day, the week, the month, and the year--is not a small thing through most of human history. So, that we have overcome that through the application of our intellectual faculties is not a small thing. And, you could argue there's trade-offs, meaning we lost something. And, I'm open to that. That's all I'm saying. Christine Webb: Right. And then, also there's this assumption that somehow these things that we've gained are applying to all humans equally, where there's food shortages, there's hunger crises in many parts of the world, including, I mean, in the United States where many of these advancements took place in the first place. So, I think the inequitable access in and of itself is a sign that, oh, maybe these aren't as much of a--I don't want to call it--you're not calling it a panacea, but they're not as much of solutions or advancements as we thought they were if it's only helping a certain subset of the population at the expense maybe of others. Russ Roberts: Well, I don't think that's true historically. It might be true to any one moment in time. I think the last 250 years are a rather extraordinary improvement in living standards in almost every part of the world. There are exceptions, and certainly there's inequality. 31:25 Russ Roberts: But, let's shift gears; and come back to this if you want. But, is there inequality in the chimpanzee community and in the baboon community? Tell me what, in terms of the social structure, what do we know about that, and how do primatologists think about it? Christine Webb: There are absolutely hierarchies within baboon, chimpanzee, and many other primate communities. I think it's really interesting that--I feel like we tend to have these two views of nature and therefore of humans. We're either fundamentally competitive, and hierarchical, and conflict-ridden, driven; or we are fundamentally cooperative, and peaceful, and tolerant. And, yeah, you see headlines all the time that will emphasize one of these stories over the other. Whereas in reality, I think most scientists who I know would agree that nature is always an interplay between conflict, and hierarchy, and cooperation. In fact, when I learned about dominance hierarchies in chimpanzees and baboons, I learned that they were a way of preventing conflicts because they help allocate the distribution of resources. You know that guy's going to get first dibs, and so you don't have to get into a fight with him every time. So, yeah, in some ways these sort of hierarchical arrangements can be a way of preventing conflicts in the first place. So, at the same time, I think it's really important to emphasize that conflict and cooperation kind of go hand in hand. Right? They're not, like, two different stories. They're very much part of the same story. And there's many different examples of that. Just to give one before I make a broader point is that in chimpanzees who I've worked with, it's often the most socially tense moments that facilitate cooperative acts. So, it's those tense moments that necessitate cooperative acts like resource sharing and reassuring one another. And then, those individuals who form relationships that are based on some kind of friendliness, tolerance, reciprocity--those relationships allow those individuals to out-compete others. And so, again, it's, like, where do you stop? They're always entangled, cooperation and competition. But, I just came across this study yesterday actually, an amazing study done in 2020, I believe, published in 2020, that looked at all of the major journals in ecology and just did this kind of lexical analysis for, okay, what are they focused on? Are they more focused on competition and predation, or on cooperation and mutualism? And despite the fact that competition, cooperation, predation, and mutualism, these are equally abundant in nature, right? It's not that one outshines the other. But, I think it was in the journal Ecology , almost two-thirds of the time competition was mentioned, and less than 2% of the time the word cooperation, or the theme of cooperation, was mentioned. And, I think that was one of the most pronounced examples, but this was true over many of the main journals of this field. That, even though these are equally important forces in evolution, we tend to focus on the competition, the dominance, mastery, hierarchical narrative. And part of my work, and that of my mentors, has been to focus on the other side of the story too, just to even out this imbalance. Not to say it's all that, not to say it's all pretty and cooperative, but to balance out the narrative. Russ Roberts: Yeah. I'm not sure what we learn from this, but NFL [National Football League] football is more popular than Ultimate Frisbee, or less competitive forms of Frisbee--that's even a better example. Ultimate Frisbee is competitive, but it's less violent, I guess. So, I guess that's another reason it struggles to attract people's attention. We're not just the arrogant ape: we're a competitive, violent ape. So, it doesn't surprise me that a lot of scientists find that more appealing. 36:11 Russ Roberts: I think one of the most powerful things about your book I think I enjoyed the most and found most thought-provoking--and I want you to elaborate on it--is what I would call the inner life of animals. You talked about a theory of mind of Bear, the--is he a baboon? Christine Webb: Yeah. Russ Roberts: But, I think through most of human history when we looked at--we've talked a lot about primates, so I want to move away from primates. Most of human history--we look at dogs, and cats, pets, cows, sheep, domesticated animals of various kinds, and then animals in the wild, wolves, coyotes, birds--it's hard for us to imagine that they imagine anything. And, I think that's a shortcoming on our part. And I thought your book did a very provocative job of pointing out that, just, for example, birds--which we think of as being stupid because their brains are tiny, pea-shaped, walnut-sized, they're small--and that that's a misunderstanding. And, I think of their capabilities and maybe their inner life, which we have limited access to, as you point out many times in the book. But I think what's powerful is that, I think through most of human history we thought of animals as instinctual, and us--humans--having agency. The idea of an animal playing. The idea of an animal enjoying something. The idea of an animal planning something. The idea of a bird communicating with a human and doing something more than just staying alive was seen as a form of anthropomorphism--help me out. Christine Webb: Anthropomorphism. Russ Roberts: That's the word, anthropomorphism. And, your book makes the case: there's a lot of evidence that they have some--we don't have access to it directly--but some kind of inner life. So, talk about that. You can talk about Len Howard if you want, which is an amazing story. I did not know about her. Or other examples from the animal kingdom that open your eyes, open one's eyes. Christine Webb: Yeah. I will start with the story of Len Howard and then jump into some of your questions. So, Len Howard, she was a musician and also wanted to study birds. I think maybe had some formal training in studying birds, but I'm actually not quite sure about that. But she knew that she wanted to study birds, and she knew that she wanted to understand them in a different way than the kind of governing scientific paradigm at the time, which was to study birds in captive settings, often when they're kind of terrified of humans--understandably--and see what they were capable of. And so, Len, trying to move away from that paradigm, moved into this place called Bird Cottage--it was in the countryside of England--where she opened her doors and windows to the many different kinds of birds who lived in the area; and over many, many years formed a trusting relationship with them. I mean, there's amazing photographs. She has this book called Birds As Individuals. There are amazing photographs that really show how trusting this relationship with the birds is. They're hiding in her hair and perched on her fingers as she's writing on the typewriter. And, through this trusting relationship, she came to know them as individuals, and she came to understand their mental lives, which I believe is also how humans come to understand other individuals' mental lives. It's through relationship. It's through getting to know them, right? C.S. Lewis has this famous quote: 'You can't study men. You can only get to know them.' And that's what Len Howard did with the birds. She got to know them. And, her book is filled with insights about their interior worlds that really surprised me. So, one is their capacity for teaching, so that when fledglings are about to leave the nest and don't really know about glass or other harmful things in the environment, how mothers will teach their fledglings about glass by taking a worm or a bit of food on one side of the glass so that the fledglings will peck on it, and then moving to the other side so that they're attracted to the food, and then going back to the glass so that they try to get it but realize the glass is there, so they learn that glass is there, as opposed to just flying into it one day. And, it was only through careful observation of these birds, as individuals, that she understood their capacity for teaching, which is another one of these cognitive rubicons that we thought separated humans from other forms of life. And so, I love this example because it emphasizes how the way that we study other animals is paramount to what we can learn about their interior worlds. And, coming back to this point about being in relationship with others, I think as a scientist you're often trained to sort of separate yourself from your study systems, to not form relationships with the individual animals that you study. But, in some ways, that lack of relationship I think can actually introduce more noise into the data. Right? If you are studying an individual who is terrified of you, how much are you really going to learn about their emotional and cognitive worlds? Not very much. So, I think--and I've written a lot about this not just in the book but also in my sort of scientific life as a primatologist--the importance of empathy, and forming relationships, and getting into a trusting relationship. Barbara Smuts, who is a mentor and friend of mine, she has written beautifully about this and her experiences of working with baboons. And, only really by getting to know them as individuals, through relationship, is that how she came to understand their rich mental worlds. And just to shift gears slightly, I think there is this-- coming back to your assumption or your point that many people assume that dogs, and cats, and birds, that they're not imagining or they're not planning. And, where did that assumption come from in the first place is a really interesting one, historically. I think a lot of it is maintained today by this presumption of unknowability. Like, we can never really know with absolute certainty what's going on in the mind of a dog, or a baboon, or a robin. And while that might be true, that's equally true of us right now. I can't know with certainty what's going on in your mind, even though you have human language to describe your interior states. That's not as reliable as we like to think. I think language is just another behavior. It's just another source of information. But, your body language, your pupil dilation, our history, our relation--all of those things are much, I think, more reliable indicators of your interior world. Russ Roberts: Well, you might struggle to know my interior world, but you have to also remember, I struggle. Christine Webb: I love that. Yeah. Russ Roberts: If you said, 'What are you thinking right now?' I could put words on it. I might be fooling you intentionally. More likely I'm unconsciously fooling myself. But, I think you're onto something, in the pet world in particular. We want so much to communicate with our pets, and they don't talk. And, it's a very frustrating thing. And so, I guess it is somewhat natural, again, through most of history, but I think it's changed in the last 40 years even, to assume they're not thinking anything. They're not talking, so they're not thinking anything. But, they have emotion in their eyes or appear to. Again, we don't know, but they certainly act as if they have an inner life that is, like you say, it's hidden from us, from our fellow human beings. It's not surprising it's not revealed very accurately in our animal friends. But, it would be absurd to go to the other extreme and say, 'Well, they're just automatons. They're just the product of instinct, and they don't have any inner life at all. They're just machines.' Christine Webb: Right. Yeah, precisely. And, I think we could just as easily say that a human is acting as if they feel an emotion, but we don't normally say that. We normally assume that. Russ Roberts: I worry about it. I do worry about it. Christine Webb: Right. Well, yeah; and I love this point that we don't even know our own subjective selves. I mean, I don't know, our own consciousness--my experience of blue the same yesterday as it was today? It's all a mystery. And we should honor that. And that doesn't mean we just throw our arms up in the air and say, 'Okay, well, we can't really know,' but we do the best that we can with the sources of information that we do have. And, in the relationships where we really get to know someone, then those sources of evidence become more and more apparent, and we don't need to say, 'Okay, they're acting as if they feel sad.' We just can say with confidence, 'They're sad.' And, there's always the possibility that we're wrong. But-- Russ Roberts: Sure, and that's true, again, of our fellow human beings. 46:27 Russ Roberts: But, I think at the other extreme, I happen to be sympathetic to the view that we have free will while being open to the possibility that we don't. But, certainly my reading, which no dog has ever suffered through, of various tractates, treatises, and books on the question of whether human beings have free will has pushed me in a particular direction. And, I may be living in a total delusion that an animal will never have to worry about because they have not read all the propaganda on one side or the other, whichever side you're sympathetic to. Christine Webb: Yeah. That point reminds me of this whole idea of, okay, you know, so much of what humans are doing--like, we're on autopilot so much of the time, right? So, much is happening beneath our conscious awareness. So, even if we, like, wanted to argue that other animals, other forms of life, were less conscious than humans--which I don't think that's a sound evolutionary argument necessarily, or one that I believe. But, even if we wanted to say, it's like, 'Okay, so their consciousness is more limited,' but that also might mean that their subconscious world is more limited, and maybe they're living actually more in their conscious, and we're the ones who are just tip of the iceberg, and then everything's beneath the surface. Like, in either case, you could sort of question this notion of human superiority--right?--that maybe a lot of it is just happening beneath the surface, and we have no idea, no control over it whatsoever. Russ Roberts: When we think of the meditative or mindfulness ideal of be here now, I suspect animals are better at that than we are. I don't think they're very good at planning. I don't think--be interested if you disagree--but I don't think they know they're going to die. And, we are burdened by that in intense ways. They don't have a culture that discusses death, as far as I know, or that communicates the idea of death. So, those birds playing in Len Howard's hair or on her keyboard, fingers maybe were just enjoying themselves, not worrying about the fact that winter is coming and they're going to have a tough time, or a bunch of them are going to die, or their fledglings are never going to--a bunch of them by definition don't make it, almost for sure. And, they just can be birds. Christine Webb: Yeah, I mean, I think this idea of planning or having a sense of future, I do think other animals are certainly capable of that. When you look at birds who are caching food for the winter coming--and they're making plans, they're storing them in thousands of separate locations that they know that they'll be able to access. Dan Gilbert in his book, Stumbling on Happiness , he talks about this thing called 'The Sentence,' which you said before: 'The human is the only animal that'--and he completes that sentence with 'has a sense of the future.' But, he also says in that same part of the book that every scientist tries to say this, but often they're proven wrong later in their career or something like that. And I think that there has been pretty good evidence that animals can plan and have a sense of the future. This question about death is a really interesting one. It's the basis of what's called terror management theory, which is that because humans have a sense of their own mortality that infuses so much of their lives and causes sort of angst and distress, and also reminds them of their own animality--like, their own animal bodies and maybe their inability to transcend that. So, there's a lot of interesting work on the relationship between terror management theory and humans seeing themselves as animals, or not. I wonder, in these conversations--so I don't think humans have a unified understanding of death. I think that we have absolutely no--and does every human know that they're going to die? What does that even mean? Some people think that they're going to an afterlife, so is that actually dying? Some people believe--I don't really understand. I don't understand this concept of death. So, I sort of come back to this point of, I'm not sure that we have a solid grasp on this either. And, therefore to deny it to other animals, who I think are also--they do show signs that they're trying to survive, right? They're not running into the jaws of predators out there. I mean, they're acting as if they understand and have a will to live. So, I'm not prepared to deny them that capacity. Maybe--it sounds like you are. 51:42 Russ Roberts: Well, I would just say one thing, that--I don't think I've ever heard anyone make this observation, but it seems embarrassingly true. It's very commonly said that every person is going to die. And, people say this as if it's an empirical fact. They say, 'Well, everybody dies.' And yet, there's about 10 billion people on this planet who are alive and have yet to die. And, the presumption that they will die is, I think, a good one, but it's not a closed, open-and-shut case that everybody who is alive today is going to eventually die. We say that because we believe intellectually in mortality, but as an empirical matter, it is not an established fact. But, people treat it like it's a fact, like the earth revolves around the sun. It's not of the same kind. But, having said that, I want to come back to your point about animals', creatures' understanding of their own mortality, and their ability to plan, and make a separate point that I'd like to hear your reaction to. So, the squirrel, the bird, many creatures cache food for hard times. So, do human beings, obviously; they save for a quote, \"rainy day.\" And, I think historically, again, in the scientific literature, when you ask, well, why does a bird cache food? Why does a squirrel cache food? The answer has always been: instinct. Which I have always believed is a way of saying we don't know. In other words, I don't think there's a genetic infallibility, a genetic determinism that teaches--not teaches--that coerces animals of that kind to cache, to hide food for the winter. I don't think we really understand that very well. I think we have a better understanding, perhaps, of some of the more extraordinary animal feats, but still not very good. The ability of an animal, of a bird to return from a multi-thousand-mile journey to the place it came from, or a salmon to return to its spawning bed, I think we, quote, \"understand it.\" We would say it's instinct, and then we would say, 'Yeah, it has something to do with appreciation for magnetic fields.' But, it's a really terrible explanation. It's not a good explanation. But, we know they don't have manuals, and we know they aren't taught in school, so we fall back and say it's instinct. But, that to me is just a technical way of saying we don't understand it. Maybe we will. But I don't think it's proof that they foresee things. But, maybe I'm wrong. Christine Webb: I think it's interesting that when you hear an explanation that is based on instinct, that that sort of leads you, or you interpret that, as more like a humble posture in a way. It's like, 'Well, we just don't know.' I find that really interesting. I haven't heard that before. When I hear the word 'instinct,' I think of automata. I think of: they have no choice in the matter, how they're doing this. So, I don't take it as, we don't know. I take it as, we know, and it's not more complicated than pre-programmed genetics. And, I think that's a shame. I would much prefer the idea of looking at: Okay, well, we call it instinct just because we don't actually have a better explanation yet. But, I also think what's interesting is, like, that any behavior can be explained at different levels of analysis, and we're so quick sometimes to focus on the genetic or the molecular one. Right? Like, when I'm typing on my computer, that can be reduced to a very physical, anatomical, neurons-firing-causing-this-muscle-to-do-that explanation. But, that is one explanation for a phenomenon that is far more layered and complex. Right? Just because you can explain it there doesn't mean that I'm not conscious of doing it, or that I'm not having will, or intention, or planning, or a desire. So, I think that's really important, too, in our ways of studying other animals, that, like, just because something can be explained at one level of analysis doesn't preclude these other possibilities that maybe we just don't know yet, or don't fully understand yet, from being important explanations that don't negate the other more, let's say, physical or biological explanations. But they are additional layers explaining the same behavior or phenomenon. 57:08 Russ Roberts: I say this thing about instinct that means we don't understand it because I don't think we've established the mechanisms by which those instincts get fulfilled. I mean, have--I'd say it a different way, maybe. 'Instinct' maybe is not the right word. I think human beings are hardwired to acquire language. They might not. I mean, a child isolated for its childhood and then at 18 plopped into society, I don't think could speak. But, built into the software of our humanity is that when people talk to us, we imitate them and we learn how to speak. Which is extraordinary, by the way. It never ceases to amaze me, because it doesn't matter where you grow up, you're going to learn a different language in at least a few hundred different places depending on where you're born, without your choice. And, yet the software is really flexible. I mean, that's an astounding thing that amazes me. But, the idea that a bird could fly thousands of miles, and by the way, endure all kinds of very unpleasant situations. There was that remarkable experiment where they took a bunch of birds--I forget what species it was. I think it was in Japan. They took them a few thousand miles away. Half of them they didn't do it, that was the control group. They all came back. They all came back to the same apartment building or the same lab in wherever it was in Japan. The other six, or whatever number it was, they did a little surgery and they took out a little piece of iron that is in the brain of the bird. And, of those six--I don't know if this is exactly right, I don't know if I have the numbers right--but five of them were never seen again. And the sixth somehow--in my tragicomic version of it--comes home with tattered clothes, missing an ear: birds don't have ears--like Van Gogh. And, after an unimaginable amount of time. It's, like, whatever the journey was, it was like three years later, this bird shows up, like, 'Yeah, I made it.' But, they don't have any idea how, except because the other five didn't make it, they understood--whatever that means, 'understood'--the scientists understood that the bird somehow, we don't know how, used the electromagnetic field of the earth, and the magnetic--excuse me, the magnetic field of the earth. And, that little piece of metal helps them somehow navigate. I mean, again, it's so magical. It's absurd to say, 'Oh, well, it turns out we know: they just use the magnetic field of the earth.' That's not that helpful. Christine Webb: Right. That's all it is. Yeah, right. No, I mean, it's a magical explanation in its own. And then, I would add onto that, that just because they do that doesn't mean that they're not conscious, or making plans, or are cognitive--like, instinct [?]people mindless. It doesn't mean that it's necessarily mindless. Aspects of it can be instinctive, aspects of it can be minded. They're not always so either/or. Russ Roberts: Yeah, I agree. 1:00:49 Russ Roberts: You write, quote: We talk about our oceans, our planet, but could we reframe this possessive language to instead reflect that shared sense of belonging to a place that co-constitutes our very being? Perhaps then we'd no longer be quite so afraid of death. End of quote. That's a--I think of it a little bit differently, but certainly our connection to the earth is some solace, potentially, in the face of mortality. Talk about that and about the role of awe in your work. Christine Webb: So, I think there's a lot to say here, but one way of approaching it is just through my own experience of unlearning human exceptionalism and how that actually did make me less afraid of death. And, it's not that I don't fear it, but that there is something about seeing humans as part of a bigger picture and a bigger story. And also, I think in the particular chapter you're quoting from, I talk a lot about the myth of individualism. Right? This idea that we are somehow these biological individuals, when most of our body actually is composed of viruses and bacteria, members of other species. That there's just so much that sort of challenges this idea that, okay, we are individual humans, and we are not these multi-species collectives in and of ourselves. And so, when we die, part of that multi-species collective lives on, or feeds other forms of life. And so, it's like seeing yourself as a part of a bigger, grander earthly narrative, I think helps you to see that the end of--it might be the end of you, but you were never just you in the first place. If that makes sense? And, I do think this is related to experiences of awe. So, there's been more and more research on awe in recent years. And in some ways, I don't think that that is a total coincidence. I think we need more awe now than ever. And, awe is described as this emotional experience of vastness that requires accommodation to understand this vastness. So, a lot of people experience awe when they're in nature. I've experienced it. I was charged by a male silverback gorilla, and it was one of the most terrifying moments of my life. I thought I was going to die. And, here's this gorilla who is five times my size, angry because we had disturbed his peaceful resting time. And, I felt very small, and very not-in-control of the situation, and very terrified. But, afterwards, and still today, reflect on that moment as a moment of awe and wonder at just how this being held so much power over me and could completely control the situation. It was really incredible. And I think awe, and humility, as kind of the antidote to the arrogance that the arrogant ape maybe doesn't see he has. But, awe and humility are very much related. So, there's been a lot of research on how awe leads to a greater sense of humility and also pro-social behaviors. So, when people experience awe, they experience this sort of diminishment of the self and the self-concept that then allows them to be more interested in others and in helping others. And I think that those others need not be human. Others, they could be other forms of life, too. So I do--yeah--I think this notion of belonging and awe, and again, I think the benefits of awe in terms of how it leads us to treat others has been mostly focused on human-to-human relationships. But, I do think those experiences absolutely influence how we treat and perceive the rest of nature as well. Russ Roberts: Religion used to play that role in Western society--the diminishment, the sense of belonging, or both, part of that. And of course, for people who are religious today, it still does play that role. But, I think for people who are not, or who that doesn't speak to--and nature has always been an alternative to religion in some dimension. But, the ability--I don't have any problem, I would just say it this way and I'll let you close this out: I'm in awe of it all. The fact that human beings can say anything at all about the origin of the universe is awe-some. That we have language, that we have abstract thought, that we have calculus--even cell phones, which I have mixed feelings about, are kind of remarkable. And, your book, or many books, that somehow give me the ability to get inside your head, at least as best as you can communicate it, as best as you think you know yourself, with all the struggles we talked about earlier of self-awareness. And, everything else: the octopus, and the bird that comes home, and the salmon that comes home, and the social gatherings of creatures, and beehives, and ants. They're all awesome to me. Christine Webb: Yeah; no; I can relate to that. One of the things that is awe-inspiring to me is just New York City. It's such a human-dominated space; and environmentally we--but it is awesome, right? It is overpowering and sort of requires a lot of accommodation to just appreciate that sense of vastness. But, I think that there's also something really powerful about what we don't know. Right? And so, yes, we can sort of understand the origins of the universe, but, like, what about before that? That is what gives me awe: those question marks and the concept of infinity. That is where--for me, awe is also, it can be this uncomfortable feeling. It's also origin of the word 'awful.' It's not just awesome. It's also awful and terrifying. And, yeah, maybe a good way of closing out that sort of relates to that is the importance of not knowing in terms of how we navigate ecological crisis. Because in my classroom, a lot of the conversations would end on this kind of despairing note: What are we going to do? It seems like we're moving in a worse direction every day. And, I'd like to share this important distinction between hope and optimism, because I think of optimism as more probabilistic Like pessimism: It sort of seems to know the odds. It predicts a better future is likely. Or, a worse future is likely in the case of pessimism. And, I would say that if I had to choose between these two options, I would be more pessimistic about the path forward, given where we are and where it seems things are headed. But, instead of that, I tend towards hope because hope is actually about not knowing. And, I think hope is more aligned with awe and with humility because it actually is not a probabilistic estimate. It's just saying there's a chance, right? It's coming back to this idea of mortality and the billions of humans that we assume are going to die. There's always a chance that we won't, right? And so, but, and it's not that dire in my mind, the odds. But it's not about making odds. It's just about recognizing that we don't know everything and that anything is possible in some ways. So, yeah, that is hopefully a hopeful message to close out on: that, even if you're not optimistic, you can still be hopeful. And, that I think is aligned with a humble outlook.

      "transcript": "The Knowledge Project Podcast [Outliers] John Bragg: The Unknown Billionaire Who Controls Half the World\u2019s Blueberries One man controls half the world\u2019s wild blueberries, built North America\u2019s largest private telecom, and did it all without ever leaving his hometown of 1,100 people. In this episode, we decode the counterintuitive playbook of patient capital, rural advantage, and why Bragg\u2019s refusal to sell a single share made him unstoppable. Now Available: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Transcript My interview with John (#204) was the class. This is the homework. Lessons from John Bragg: Bounce, Don\u2019t Break: In 1968, John Bragg borrowed everything to build his first processing plant. To say he was all in was an understatement. Then frost killed his entire crop. It was a disaster. He had a nearly empty factory, barely any revenue, and a lot of bills to pay. Most people would have declared bankruptcy. Instead, Bragg called Wallace McCain at midnight: \u201cWhat do you need that you don\u2019t want to make yourself?\u201d McCain threw him a file on onion rings. Bragg had never made an onion ring, but he had an empty factory and no choice. When you\u2019re staring at complete ruin, the question isn\u2019t \u201cWhy me?\u201d It\u2019s \u201cWhat now?\u201d Reputation is Currency: The bank manager laughed Bragg out of the office when he needed his first loan. But a Conservative politician stood up for the Liberal Bragg family: \u201cIf we can\u2019t lend money to the Bragg family, we can\u2019t lend money to anybody.\u201d Later, Bragg intentionally overpaid for acquisitions. Word spread fast: if you want to sell, call John Bragg. Fair price, quick close, no games. While competitors fought over pennies on one deal, Bragg was already closing three more. You can\u2019t buy reputation. You can only earn it, one interaction at a time. Look to the Horizon : In 1969, nobody wanted a cable TV license for Amherst, Nova Scotia. Population: 9,000. Bragg was the only applicant. Early cable meant recording shows on tapes, putting them on buses, and playing two-week-old programming. While others saw losses, Bragg saw rural communities desperate for connection, recurring revenue, and a shrinking world. \u201cWe\u2019re big, big believers in looking at the horizon,\u201d he says, quoting Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld: \u201cOnly those who look at the horizon find the right road. If you look at your feet, you\u2019ll stumble.\u201d That license, which nobody wanted, was the first brick in what would become North America\u2019s largest private telecom empire. Grow the Pie: Bragg\u2019s brother invented a blueberry harvester that did the work of thirty hand pickers. Instead of keeping it secret, they sold harvesters to competitors. \u201cWhat\u2019s good for the industry is good for everyone,\u201d Bragg said. He wasn\u2019t competing against other blueberry growers; he was competing against every other fruit. This drives people crazy. Even today, Oxford funds research on growing and cultivating and shares everything freely. While other people want to divide the pie, John Bragg wants to grow it for everyone. Overpay for What\u2019s Only Available Once: Bragg routinely paid more than competitors for acquisitions. Sometimes double. His reasoning is simple: \u201cIt\u2019s only available once.\u201d When opportunities are scarce, pay what it takes. The people who nickel and dime their way out of great deals spend years regretting it. No Reverse Gear : At 22, Bragg turned down a secure teaching job to pick wild blueberries. Everyone thought he\u2019d lost his mind. When his business was on the verge of failure, he persevered. When banks rejected him, he found another way. When Bell killed his partnership, he borrowed $265 million and built a competitor instead. \u201cI have no reverse gear,\u201d Bragg says. The world is full of people who almost started something, almost took the risk, almost bet on themselves. Don\u2019t be one of them. Outcome Over Ego: Bragg could have named his companies after himself. Instead, Oxford and Eastlink. \u201cNever let your ego run your business,\u201d he says. At 85, worth billions, he still uses scuffed golf balls. \u201cThey go as far as new ones.\u201d His headquarters look like a community college. Every dollar that doesn\u2019t feed your ego feeds your growth. Most people would rather look successful than be successful. That\u2019s why most people aren\u2019t as successful as they could be. Lead by Suggestion: Every month, Bragg drives to his executives instead of summoning them. He rarely gives orders. When a beekeeper said 2,500 hives were his limit, Bragg didn\u2019t bark commands. He said, \u201cI have confidence you can handle more. Think about how.\u201d The beekeeper redesigned everything and now manages 12,000 hives. Strong leaders help people discover their full potential. Never Stop Learning: At 70, worth hundreds of millions, Bragg gave six teams of executives $10 million each, not for bonuses, but for investment portfolios. Real money, real stakes. \u201cI wanted them to see how strong companies operate and how weak ones fail,\u201d he said. No penalties for losses, no bonuses for gains. Pure education. Bragg himself became a student, attending Berkshire Hathaway meetings, studying other businesses. His favorite Buffett quote: \u201cI am a better investor because I am a businessman and a better businessman because I am an investor.\u201d Most people stop learning once they become successful. Outliers never stop being students. Stay Private, Stay Nimble: For fifty years, banks begged Bragg to go public. He refused. When he acquired AM Telecom, a publicly traded company, he immediately eliminated $4 million in overhead. \u201cIt\u2019s costly to be public, and it slows you down,\u201d Bragg says. Public companies need board approvals, regulatory filings, and quarterly guidance. When Bragg\u2019s engineers recommended new technology, he gave them $10 million the same day. Patient Capital Wins: For fifty years, Bragg reinvested every dollar back into growth. While competitors paid shareholders, Bragg continued to compound. Bragg thought in generations. In a world of quick flips and fast exits, the person willing to wait twenty years has no competition. More Resources/Sources Savoie, Donald J.
