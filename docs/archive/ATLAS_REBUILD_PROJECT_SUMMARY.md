# Atlas Rebuild - Archon Project Summary

**Project ID**: ATLAS_REBUILD_20251016
**Status**: Active (Phase 0 in progress)
**Priority**: Critical
**Created**: October 16, 2025
**Estimated Duration**: 14 days

## Executive Summary

The Atlas Rebuild project addresses a critical system failure where the Atlas content ingestion system has stopped processing new content since October 2, 2025. Despite having a valuable database with 25,831 content records (15,977 substantial), the system is caught in a death spiral with processes receiving SIGTERM signals every 30 seconds.

This project combines the strategic roadmap from the reliability implementation plan with the immediate needs identified in the comprehensive system audit to create a phased rebuild approach that preserves existing value while fixing critical issues.

## Current System State

### ✅ What's Working (Preserve)
- **Database**: 25,831 content records with 15,977 substantial pieces of content
- **Core Logic**: Content extraction and RSS discovery functionality
- **User-Agent**: Fixed to prevent HTTP 403 errors

### 🚨 What's Broken (Fix)
- **Zero New Content**: No processing since October 2, 2025
- **Process Death Spiral**: SIGTERM signals killing processes every 30 seconds
- **Queue Pollution**: 37% of processing queue consumed by non-processable file:// URLs
- **Competing Services**: Multiple SystemD services interfering with each other

## Project Phases

### Phase 0: Archive Old Code & Clean Start (2 hours) ⏳ IN PROGRESS
**Objective**: Secure existing assets and eliminate process conflicts

- ✅ **Phase 0.1**: Create comprehensive backup of database and working code (IN PROGRESS)
- ⏳ **Phase 0.2**: Disable all SystemD services and stop competing processes
- ⏳ **Phase 0.3**: Identify and eliminate SIGTERM source causing process death spiral

**Success Criteria**:
- Complete backup of `data/atlas.db` and essential code
- All competing processes stopped
- SIGTERM source identified and eliminated

### Phase 1: Critical Queue Cleanup (1 day)
**Objective**: Eliminate 37% queue pollution from file:// URLs

- ⏳ **Phase 1.1**: Implement URL classification service to identify file:// vs HTTP URLs
- ⏳ **Phase 1.2**: Create dead letter queue and move 19,589 file:// URLs out of processing queue
- ⏳ **Phase 1.3**: Implement basic deduplication with content ID generation from URL hash

**Success Criteria**:
- 0% file:// URLs in active processing queue
- Queue efficiency improved from 63% to 95%+
- Duplicate prevention implemented

### Phase 2: Core Engine Rebuild (3 days)
**Objective**: Create simplified, reliable processing engine

- ⏳ **Phase 2.1**: Create simplified atlas_simple.py single entry point script
- ⏳ **Phase 2.2**: Extract and refactor content extraction logic from universal_url_processor.py
- ⏳ **Phase 2.3**: Implement error classification and retry with exponential backoff
- ⏳ **Phase 2.4**: Add basic priority queue management and backpressure handling

**Success Criteria**:
- Single process runs continuously without crashes
- Processing rate restored to 600+ items/hour
- Intelligent error handling implemented

### Phase 3: Validation & Testing (2 days)
**Objective**: Ensure system processes content reliably

- ⏳ **Phase 3.1**: Test end-to-end content processing with RSS feeds
- ⏳ **Phase 3.2**: Validate duplicate prevention works with various URL patterns
- ⏳ **Phase 3.3**: Stress test with high-volume content ingestion

**Success Criteria**:
- End-to-end content processing working
- 100% duplicate prevention accuracy
- System handles high-volume input without degradation

### Phase 4: Essential Monitoring (2 days)
**Objective**: Add basic monitoring without complexity

- ⏳ **Phase 4.1**: Implement basic metrics collection (processing rate, success rate)
- ⏳ **Phase 4.2**: Create simple alerting for critical failures only
- ⏳ **Phase 4.3**: Add basic health check endpoint for status monitoring

**Success Criteria**:
- Basic metrics available without complex infrastructure
- Critical failures generate alerts
- Simple health status endpoint

### Phase 5: Deployment & Hardening (1 day)
**Objective**: Production-ready deployment

- ⏳ **Phase 5.1**: Create simple startup scripts and basic configuration management
- ⏳ **Phase 5.2**: Document deployment procedures and recovery steps
- ⏳ **Phase 5.3**: Final integration testing and performance validation

**Success Criteria**:
- Reliable startup and shutdown procedures
- Complete documentation
- Production-ready system

## Key Milestones

1. **System Stabilized** (Oct 16, 2025) - Process death spiral eliminated
2. **Queue Cleaned** (Oct 17, 2025) - 37% queue pollution eliminated
3. **Content Processing Restored** (Oct 20, 2025) - System processing new content
4. **Production Ready** (Oct 22, 2025) - Fully validated and documented

## Success Metrics

- **Stability**: Process runs continuously without SIGTERM death spiral
- **Efficiency**: Queue efficiency > 95% (up from 63%)
- **Performance**: Processing rate > 600 items/hour
- **Reliability**: Duplicate prevention 100% accurate
- **Data Preservation**: All 25,831 existing content records maintained

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Risks
1. **Data Loss During Migration** - Complete backups before any changes
2. **SIGTERM Source Unknown** - Systematic debugging with monitoring tools
3. **Performance Degradation** - Benchmark and test each incremental change

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive backup strategy with multiple copies
- Incremental implementation with testing at each phase
- Rollback capability for all major changes
- Extensive logging and monitoring during transition

## Current Status

**Active Work**: Phase 0.1 - Creating comprehensive backup of database and working code

**Next Immediate Tasks**:
1. Complete backup of `data/atlas.db` (25,831 records)
2. Backup essential Python files (`atlas_manager.py`, `universal_url_processor.py`, etc.)
3. Document current system state before making changes

## Project Assets

### Critical Assets to Preserve
- `data/atlas.db` - 25,831 content records
- `universal_url_processor.py` - Content extraction logic (User-Agent fixed)
- `atlas_manager.py` - Main entry point that created the content
- RSS feed configurations in `config/podcast_*.csv`

### Project Files Created
- `archon_project_atlas_rebuild.json` - Complete project structure and task definitions
- `ATLAS_REBUILD_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document
- Todo list with 25 trackable tasks across 6 phases

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase 0.1**: Finish comprehensive backup creation
2. **Execute Phase 0.2**: Disable all SystemD services and competing processes
3. **Debug Phase 0.3**: Identify and eliminate SIGTERM source
4. **Begin Phase 1**: Start queue cleanup implementation
