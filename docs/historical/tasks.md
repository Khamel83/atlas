- Data consistency issues - Could indicate fundamental design problems
- Processing pipeline restart - May require significant debugging

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Take system snapshots before major changes
- Test fixes in isolation before full deployment
- Keep detailed logs of all changes made
- Have rollback procedures ready

**Abort Criteria**:
- If service cycling can't be fixed in 2+ hours
- If data consistency issues are too complex to resolve
- If processing pipeline requires major architecture changes
