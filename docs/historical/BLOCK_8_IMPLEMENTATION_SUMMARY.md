## Dependencies

All required dependencies are listed in `requirements-analytics.txt`:
- Flask (web framework)
- Matplotlib (charting library)
- Pandas (data processing)
- NumPy (numerical computing)

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-analytics.txt
   ```

2. Run tests to verify installation:
   ```bash
   python tests/test_analytics.py
   ```

3. Run demo to see functionality:
   ```bash
   python scripts/demo_analytics.py
   ```

## Usage

### Core Dashboard Module
```python
from analytics.dashboard import PersonalAnalyticsDashboard

dashboard = PersonalAnalyticsDashboard()
data = dashboard.get_dashboard_data()
print(f"System metrics: {data['metrics']['system']}")
```

### Analytics API
```python
from api.analytics_api import analytics_bp

# Register blueprint with Flask app
app.register_blueprint(analytics_bp)

# Access endpoints:
# GET /api/analytics/dashboard
# GET /api/analytics/metrics/system
# GET /api/analytics/metrics/content
# etc.
```
