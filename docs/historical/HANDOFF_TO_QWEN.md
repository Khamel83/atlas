# ðŸ¤– Atlas Handoff to Qwen-Coder

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Setup for Autonomous Development

### **1. Install Qwen-Code CLI**
```bash
npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code@latest
```

### **2. Navigate to Atlas**
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/dev/atlas
```

### **3. Run Setup Script**
```bash
./QWEN_SETUP_SCRIPT.sh
```

### **4. Start Qwen-Code**
```bash
qwen
```

### **5. Give Initial Instructions**
Copy this exact prompt to Qwen-Code:

## ðŸ¤– INITIAL PROMPT FOR QWEN-CODER

```
I need you to autonomously implement Atlas development Blocks 7-10. You are working in the /home/ubuntu/dev/atlas directory.

FIRST, read these files to understand the project:
1. QWEN_CODER_INSTRUCTIONS.md - Your complete autonomous development instructions
2. CLAUDE.md - Project context and current status
3. docs/specs/BLOCKS_7-10_IMPLEMENTATION.md - Detailed implementation specifications

THEN, start implementing Block 7.1: Advanced Siri Shortcuts Integration.

Your goal is to work systematically through all implementation blocks until you run out of tokens or complete all work.

Start by running the startup script to understand the current state:
./start_work.sh

Then begin implementation of apple_shortcuts/siri_shortcuts.py following the specifications exactly.

EFFICIENCY RULES:
- 5-minute rule: If stuck >5min on any task, skip it and move on
- Code immediately: Start with working skeleton, no over-analysis
- Compress context: After each component, summarize progress only
- Ship working code: Partial implementation > no implementation

BEGIN NOW - START CODING WITHIN 2 PROMPTS MAX.
```

## ðŸ“‹ What Qwen-Coder Will Do

### **Systematic Implementation:**
1. **Block 7**: Enhanced Apple Features (iOS integration, voice processing)
2. **Block 8**: Personal Analytics Dashboard (web interface, insights)
3. **Block 9**: Enhanced Search & Indexing (semantic search, knowledge graphs)
4. **Block 10**: Advanced Content Processing (AI summarization, recommendations)

### **Expected Output:**
- **Production-ready code** following Atlas architecture patterns
- **Comprehensive testing** with >90% coverage targets
- **Integration** with existing background service and processing pipeline
- **Documentation** and type annotations for all new functionality

### **Safety Measures:**
- âœ… **Never breaks existing functionality** - robust error handling
- âœ… **Maintains data integrity** - background ingestion continues
- âœ… **Follows patterns** - consistent with existing codebase
- âœ… **Tests everything** - comprehensive test coverage

### **Progress Tracking:**
Qwen-Coder will work through 180+ specific tasks across 4 major blocks, implementing features like:
- iOS Siri Shortcuts with voice commands
- Real-time web dashboard with analytics
- Semantic search with vector embeddings
- AI-powered content summarization and recommendations

### **Token Efficiency:**
The instructions are designed for maximum autonomous productivity - Qwen-Coder will:
- Focus on core functionality first
- Implement incrementally with frequent testing
- Prioritize working code over perfect code initially
- Work until tokens are exhausted or all tasks complete

## ðŸš€ Expected Timeline

**Conservative**: 2-3 major components implemented
**Realistic**: 1-2 complete blocks with testing
**Optimistic**: All 4 blocks with integration testing

The instructions provide fallback priorities if token-limited, ensuring the most valuable features get implemented first.
