# Atlas Project Status

**Last Updated**: August 27, 2025
**Document Status**: AUTHORITATIVE - This is the single source of truth for project status.

## 🎯 Overall Status

Atlas is a partially-implemented content ingestion and analysis platform. The core data pipelines for ingesting articles, podcasts, and other web content are functional. However, most of the advanced features related to search, analytics, and cognitive insights are either in a basic state or exist as stubs and require significant implementation work.

The background services that power the ingestion have known stability issues which are being addressed by hardening the service manager and individual scripts with pre-flight resource checks and circuit breakers.

### 📈 High-Level Component Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Ingestion Pipeline** | ✅ **Operational** | Can process articles, podcasts, YouTube, and emails. |
| **Background Services** | 🔧 **In Progress** | Being hardened to fix stability issues. |
| **Search & Indexing** | 🔧 **In Progress** | Basic full-text search is functional. Ranking and semantic search are not implemented. |
| **Analytics Dashboard** | 📝 **Stubs Only** | The UI and API exist as placeholders but are not connected to real data. |
| **Cognitive Features** | 📝 **Stubs Only** | The APIs exist but return mock data. The underlying intelligence is not implemented. |
| **Deployment (Docker/OCI)** | 📝 **Stubs Only** | Scripts and Dockerfiles exist but have not been validated. |

## 📋 Detailed Block Status

This breakdown is based on the original project blocks.

### ✅ Operational / Implemented

*   **Blocks 1-3: Core Platform**
    *   **Status**: ✅ Operational
    *   **Details**: The main data ingestion pipelines for articles, podcasts, and YouTube content are working. Includes advanced recovery and retry mechanisms.
*   **Block 15: Intelligent Metadata Discovery**
    *   **Status**: ✅ Operational
    *   **Details**: Can extract metadata from YouTube history and GitHub repositories found in content.
*   **Block 16: Email Integration**
    *   **Status**: ✅ Operational
    *   **Details**: A full IMAP pipeline for ingesting emails and newsletters is functional and tested.

### 🔧 In Progress / Partially Implemented

*   **Block 8: Personal Analytics Dashboard**
    *   **Status**: 🔧 In Progress
    *   **Details**: The Python classes and basic API endpoints exist, but they are not connected to a data backend. The dashboard shows placeholder information.
*   **Block 9: Enhanced Search & Indexing**
    *   **Status**: 🔧 In Progress
    *   **Details**: A basic SQLite-based full-text search (FTS5) is in place. It lacks intelligent ranking, semantic search, and advanced filtering.
*   **Block 10: Advanced Content Processing**
    *   **Status**: 🔧 In Progress
    *   **Details**: Basic summarization and classification frameworks are in place but require integration with a real AI/LLM provider to be useful.

### 📝 Not Implemented / Stubs Only

*   **Blocks 4-7: Export & Apple Integration**
    *   **Status**: 📝 Stubs Only
    *   **Details**: Scripts and frameworks exist for exporting content and integrating with Apple Shortcuts, but they have not been tested or validated.
*   **Blocks 11-13: Cognitive Features**
    *   **Status**: 📝 Stubs Only
    *   **Details**: These features (e.g., ProactiveSurfacer, TemporalEngine) exist only as placeholder classes and API endpoints. There is no underlying implementation.
*   **Block 14: Production Hardening**
    *   **Status**: 📝 Stubs Only
    *   **Details**: Scripts for deploying with Docker, setting up monitoring (Prometheus), and managing the service with systemd exist but have not been run or validated.

## 🚀 Immediate Priorities

1.  **Stabilize Background Services**: Complete the hardening of all service scripts to prevent resource exhaustion and crashes. (In Progress)
2.  **Implement Search Ranking**: Move beyond basic full-text search to provide relevance-ranked results.
3.  **Connect Analytics Dashboard**: Integrate the dashboard with the database to display real user analytics.
4.  **Implement a Real Cognitive Feature**: Replace a mock cognitive feature with a real implementation to prove out the architecture.
5.  **Validate Deployment Scripts**: Test and document the Docker/OCI deployment process.
