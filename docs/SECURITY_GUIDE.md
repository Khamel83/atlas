# Security Guide for Atlas

## Essential Security Measures

### File System Security
```bash
# Set secure permissions for .env file
chmod 600 .env

# Secure your data directory
chmod 700 /path/to/your/data/directory

# Use full-disk encryption (strongly recommended)
# macOS: FileVault
# Windows: BitLocker
# Linux: LUKS
```

### API Key Management
- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** via .env files only
- **Rotate keys regularly** if supported by the service
- **Monitor API usage** to detect unauthorized access
- **Use least-privilege keys** when available

### Network Security
- **Use HTTPS** for all external requests (Atlas does this by default)
- **Be cautious on public networks** when downloading content
- **Consider VPN** for sensitive research topics
- **Monitor network traffic** if processing sensitive content

### Data Protection
- **Full-disk encryption** is essential - Atlas doesn't encrypt data at rest
- **Regular backups** to secure, offline storage
- **Access controls** on your device and data directory
- **Secure deletion** when removing sensitive content

## Privacy Considerations

### Local Processing
- **AI processing** happens locally when possible (Whisper, local models)
- **External APIs** only used when you configure them
- **No telemetry** or usage data collection
- **No cloud dependencies** for core functionality

### Content Handling
- **Source attribution** preserved in metadata
- **Processing logs** may contain content snippets
- **Temporary files** created during processing - cleaned automatically
- **Cache files** may persist - review periodically

### Third-Party Services
When you configure external APIs:
- **Review privacy policies** of each service
- **Understand data handling** practices
- **Monitor usage** through service dashboards
- **Consider data residency** requirements

## Threat Model Considerations

### What Atlas Protects Against
- **Vendor lock-in** - All data in standard formats
- **Service shutdown** - Everything stored locally
- **Unauthorized cloud access** - No required cloud services
- **Data loss** - If you maintain proper backups

### What You Must Protect Against
- **Device theft/loss** - Use full-disk encryption
- **Malware** - Keep system updated and use antivirus
- **Social engineering** - Protect your API keys and credentials
- **Physical access** - Secure your devices and workspace

## Incident Response

### If You Suspect Compromise
1. **Disconnect from network** immediately
2. **Change all API keys** used with Atlas
3. **Review logs** for suspicious activity
4. **Scan for malware** using updated antivirus
5. **Consider data integrity** - restore from clean backups if needed

### Regular Security Maintenance
- **Update dependencies** monthly: `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`
- **Review logs** weekly for errors or warnings
- **Backup verification** - test restore procedures quarterly
- **Permission audit** - ensure file permissions remain secure

## Compliance Considerations

### For Regulated Industries
If you work in regulated industries (healthcare, finance, etc.):
- **Consult legal counsel** before processing work-related content
- **Consider data classification** requirements
- **Review retention policies** and implement accordingly
- **Document security measures** for audit purposes

### International Users
- **Know your local laws** regarding data processing and AI usage
- **Consider data residency** if using external APIs
- **Export restrictions** may apply to AI/cryptographic software
- **Privacy laws** (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) may apply even for personal use

Remember: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup.
