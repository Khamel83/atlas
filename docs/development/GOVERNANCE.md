# Atlas Governance

## Overview

This document outlines the governance structure of the Atlas project. Atlas is an open-source project that welcomes contributions from anyone. The project is governed by a combination of community consensus and leadership from key maintainers.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Contributors
Anyone who contributes to Atlas in any form (code, documentation, testing, feedback, etc.) is considered a contributor. Contributors are encouraged to participate in discussions, submit issues and pull requests, and help improve the project.

### Maintainers
Maintainers are responsible for the overall direction and health of the Atlas project. Their responsibilities include:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Managing the release process
- Responding to issues and community feedback
- Setting project priorities and roadmap
- Maintaining documentation and community resources
- Ensuring security and quality standards are met

Current maintainers:
- Lead Maintainer: [Lead Maintainer Name]
- Core Maintainers: [Maintainer 1], [Maintainer 2], [Maintainer 3]

### Technical Committee
The Technical Committee consists of senior maintainers who make decisions on technical architecture and major feature additions. They also resolve disputes when community consensus cannot be reached.

Current Technical Committee members:
- [TC Member 1]
- [TC Member 2]
- [TC Member 3]

### Steering Committee
The Steering Committee handles project-level decisions such as governance, funding, partnerships, and strategic direction. It includes representatives from the Technical Committee, community leaders, and key stakeholders.

Current Steering Committee members:
- [SC Member 1] (Chair)
- [SC Member 2]
- [SC Member 3]
- Community Representative: [Community Rep]

## Decision Making

### Consensus
Most decisions in Atlas are made through consensus. This means that substantial agreement among participants is sought before moving forward with a decision. Consensus does not require unanimous agreement, but dissenting voices should be heard and considered.

### Voting
When consensus cannot be reached on important matters, voting may be used as a last resort. Voting is typically reserved for:

- Election of committee members
- Major architectural decisions
- Changes to governance structure
- Release decisions in exceptional circumstances

Voting procedures:
- Simple majority (>50%) for most decisions
- Supermajority (2/3) for governance changes
- Quorum: At least 50% of eligible voters must participate

### RFC Process
For major changes or new features, Atlas uses a Request for Comments (RFC) process:

1. **Draft**: Contributor submits RFC draft for initial feedback
2. **Discussion**: Community discusses the proposal for at least 2 weeks
3. **Revision**: Contributor revises RFC based on feedback
4. **Decision**: Maintainers or Technical Committee makes final decision
5. **Implementation**: If approved, RFC moves to implementation phase

## Becoming a Maintainer
