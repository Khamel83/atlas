# Atlas Personal Knowledge System - Mission & Values

## üéØ Mission Statement

**Atlas exists to amplify human cognitive capacity while preserving privacy, autonomy, and meaningful control over personal knowledge.**

We believe that personal knowledge systems should:
- **Serve the individual** - Not extract data for external profit
- **Respect privacy** - Keep personal data under user control
- **Enhance learning** - Support genuine understanding over mere information storage
- **Promote autonomy** - Enable users to think more clearly, not replace thinking
- **Value quality** - Focus on meaningful insights over quantity of data

## üåü Core Values

### Privacy First
- All data processing happens locally or under user control
- No external data sharing without explicit user consent
- Transparent about what data is collected and how it's used
- User can export or delete their data at any time

### Cognitive Enhancement
- Tools should make you smarter, not dependent
- Focus on developing thinking skills and knowledge connections
- Support active learning through questioning and reflection
- Encourage deep work and focused attention

### User Autonomy
- Users maintain full control over their knowledge system
- Open source approach enables customization and verification
- No vendor lock-in or proprietary data formats
- Configurable to match individual learning styles and needs

### Quality over Quantity
