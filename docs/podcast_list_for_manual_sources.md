## Status Update:
- Atlas is still processing: **11,810 files ingested, ~1,900 articles remaining**

- Once URLs are done, we'll move to podcast transcript hunting

## Search Strategy (when you provide sources):
1. Primary: Search your provided URLs first
2. Secondary: Search specific podcast websites
3. Fallback: Web search `"podcast name" + "episode number/name" + "transcript"`

Ready for your source URLs! 🎯
