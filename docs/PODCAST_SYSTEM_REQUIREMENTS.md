## ðŸ”§ Processing Requirements

### Content Acquisition Strategy:
1. **Check user prioritization** - Only process 37 specified podcasts
2. **Respect episode counts** - Download exactly specified number OR all available if fewer exist
3. **Transcript-first approach** - For transcript-only shows, search for existing transcripts before audio download
4. **Archive management** - Only download audio for shows marked for archival

### Technical Processing:
- **Mac Mini Processing** - All transcription happens locally
- **Universal Queue** - Single processing system, no competing parallel processes
- **whisper.cpp Integration** - Fast local transcription
- **Database Storage** - All content stored in Atlas SQLite database
- **Search Integration** - Transcripts indexed for semantic search

### Quality Requirements:
- **Exact Episode Counts** - Respect user-specified numbers per podcast
- **No Unnecessary Downloads** - Don't download audio for transcript-only shows if transcript available
- **Resource Efficiency** - Use universal queue to prevent resource conflicts
- **User Prioritization** - Follow user specifications, not AI recommendations

## ðŸ“Š Current Gap Analysis

**Major Missing Content:**
- **Acquired ecosystem**: 0/2000 episodes (Acquired + ACQ2)
- **High-value interviews**: 0/700 episodes (Lex Fridman, Ezra Klein, etc.)
- **Tech analysis**: 0/2000 episodes (Stratechery, Sharp Tech)
- **Business education**: 0/300 episodes (Planet Money, EconTalk, etc.)

**Existing Content:**
- **ATP**: 10/10 episodes âœ… **COMPLETE**
- **Other podcasts**: 29 miscellaneous episodes needing classification

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Priorities

### High Priority (Immediate):
1. **Fix Search API** - Enable content searchability
2. **Build Transcription Pipeline** - Mac Mini integration with universal queue
3. **Content Acquisition** - Begin downloading priority shows (Acquired, Lex Fridman, etc.)

### Medium Priority:
4. **Search UI** - Web interface for transcript exploration
5. **Progress Dashboard** - Track acquisition and processing status

### Integration Requirements:
- **PODEMOS Coordination** - Some podcasts may be processed by both systems
- **Resource Sharing** - Universal queue prevents conflicts
- **Configuration Management** - Single .env file for all settings
