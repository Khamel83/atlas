- **Cognitive**: Access to all cognitive features
- **Settings**: Configure your Atlas installation

## Section 3: Using the Proactive Content Surfacer
One of Atlas's powerful features is the Proactive Content Surfacer. Let's explore how it works.

The Proactive Content Surfacer identifies content that you may have forgotten about but is still relevant to your current interests. It helps prevent the "I know I read about this somewhere" problem by bringing forgotten insights back to your attention.

To use it:
1. Click on the "Cognitive" menu item
2. Select "Proactive Surfacer"
3. Browse the list of forgotten content items
4. Click on any item to revisit and re-engage with the content

## Section 4: Exploring Temporal Relationships
Another powerful feature is Temporal Relationships, which analyzes when content was created or updated to identify patterns and connections between topics over time.
