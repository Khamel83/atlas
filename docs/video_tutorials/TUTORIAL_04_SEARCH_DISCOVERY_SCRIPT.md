# Atlas Tutorial 4: Search and Discovery Script

## Introduction
Hello and welcome to the fourth tutorial in the Atlas series. In this video, I'll show you how to use Atlas's search and discovery features. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to perform basic searches, use advanced search techniques, and leverage semantic search powered by AI.

Before we begin, make sure you have Atlas installed and some content processed as shown in the previous tutorials. Let's get started!

## Section 1: Basic Search Functionality
Let's start with basic search functionality in the Atlas web dashboard.

The search results show content that contains the term "machine learning" in the title or content.

## Section 2: Advanced Search Techniques
Atlas supports advanced search techniques for more precise results.

Advanced search features include:
- **Boolean operators**: AND, OR, NOT
- **Phrase search**: Use quotes for exact phrases
- **Field search**: Search specific fields (title:, content:, tags:)
- **Wildcards**: Use * for partial matching

Let's try a few examples:

1. Searching for titles containing "AI":
```
title:AI
```

2. Searching for content with "machine learning" but not "deep learning":
```
"machine learning" NOT "deep learning"
```

3. Searching for content with specific tags:
```
tags:technology OR tags:science
```

## Section 3: Semantic Search
One of Atlas's most powerful features is semantic search, which uses AI to understand the meaning and context of your content.

To use semantic search:
1. Click on the "Cognitive" menu item
2. Select "Semantic Search"
3. Enter your search query in natural language

Let's try searching for "papers about neural networks in healthcare":

Semantic search finds content that's conceptually related to your query, even if it doesn't contain the exact words.

## Section 4: Filter and Refine Results
Atlas allows you to filter and refine search results.
