# User Responsibilities

## Before You Start
Atlas is a powerful tool that requires responsible use. You are solely responsible for:

### Legal Compliance
- **Know your local laws** regarding data privacy, content processing, and AI usage
- **Respect copyright** when processing articles, videos, and other content
- **Follow website terms of service** when ingesting content from external sources
- **Comply with API terms** for any services you configure (OpenAI, etc.)

### Data Management
- **Secure your data** - Atlas stores everything locally without encryption
- **Backup regularly** - You are responsible for data backup and recovery
- **Manage API keys securely** - Store in .env files with proper permissions
- **Monitor disk usage** - Large archives can consume significant storage

### Content Quality
- **Verify information accuracy** - Atlas processes content but doesn't verify facts
- **Respect privacy** - Don't process others' personal information without permission
- **Filter inappropriate content** - You control what content enters your system
- **Consider bias** - AI processing may inherit biases from training data

### System Security
- **Keep software updated** - Regularly update Python, dependencies, and Atlas
- **Use secure networks** - Be cautious when downloading content on public networks
- **Monitor system resources** - Some operations are computationally intensive
- **Review logs regularly** - Check for errors, warnings, or security issues

## What Atlas Does NOT Do
- **Does not encrypt data** - Use full-disk encryption for security
- **Does not verify content accuracy** - You must evaluate information quality
- **Does not guarantee legal compliance** - You must ensure lawful use
- **Does not provide backup** - You must implement your own backup strategy
- **Does not offer support** - Community resources only

## Getting Help
1. **Read the documentation** thoroughly
2. **Check known issues** in troubleshooting guides
3. **Search community resources** for similar problems
4. **Review source code** if you have technical questions
5. **No official support** is provided by the authors

Remember: You are the administrator of your own knowledge system. With that power comes responsibility.
