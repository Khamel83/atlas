      "Title": "A linguist explains why Trump\u2019s silence about big issues is a brilliant power move Quartz",
      "Selection": "In recent weeks, a lot of people have condemned US president Donald\u2019s Trump\u2019s silence on the xenophobic murder of Srinivas Kuchibhotla, an Indian immigrant. The president finally spoke up, six days later, and many critiqued his response as too little, too late.\n\nWhy did he wait so long? And given how often he\u2019s been attacked for his silence on various issues, why does he continue to wait before speaking up?\n\nWhen linguists discuss the art of conversation, we often reference turn-taking. If only one person is speaking, it\u2019s obvious who holds the floor. When multiple people are speaking at once, it only becomes clear in retrospect who held the floor. But who holds the floor when nobody is speaking? And at what point does a pause become a silence?\n\nWho owns a silence?\n\nSometimes a silence is heard as belonging to nobody in particular. But more often silence is coupled with an expectation for a particular person to speak. In those cases, the silence \u201cbelongs\u201d to that particular person\u2014and other participants in the interaction will treat it that way. Consider what happens if someone is called on by name but does not respond:\n\n\u201cWhat do you think, Jena?\u201d[silence]\n\nWhat\u2019s likely to come next? Among the possibilities are \u201cEarth to Jena?\u201d \u201cAre you mad?\u201d and \u201cSo you don\u2019t like it, then?\u201d Each of these construes the meaning of the silence differently\u2014but all of them treat the silence as a meaningful turn.\n\nEvents build on the way silence\u2014or any turn in conversation\u2014is construed, rather than on the speakers\u2019 intentions. A recent example was Warren Beatty\u2019s silence before announcing the Best Picture winner at the 2017 Oscars. His co-presenter interpreted his silence as a teasing attempt to build suspense\u2014but as we later learned, Beatty was unsure how to handle what turned out to be an incorrect cue card.\n\nLike all conversational norms, silence is cultural; it means different things in different places. Even the length of time that differentiates \u2018waiting for someone else to finish their turn\u2019 from \u2018choosing not to answer\u2019 is cultural, and depends on who you are and where you are.\n\nConsider the American aphorism if you don\u2019t have something nice to say, don\u2019t say it at all. It works in reverse, too: We often understand silence to mean you have nothing nice to say. If you had a positive comment to hand, why wouldn\u2019t you just say it?\n\nSilence as security\n\nAnd yet silence can provide its own defense:\n\n\u201cDo you like it?\u201d\n[silence]\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nSilence is one way to avoid going on the record. It suggests an unwillingness to commit to any particular response. And that lack of commitment allows for plausible deniability after the fact.\n\nA silence before speaking, whether it\u2019s short or long, communicates hesitation or doubt about the speech that follows. Consider how you\u2019d feel if someone turned to you and said \u201cYour new haircut is [pause] really nice.\u201d You\u2019d doubt if they really liked it, and your doubt would be entirely due to the pause. As Deborah Tannen says in her essay Silence: Anything But, \u201cWhether or not silence is uncomfortable in interaction hinges on whether or not participants feel something should be said, in which case silence is perceived as an omission.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s silences\n\nTrump\u2019s silences are strategic. Far from learning to speak up more quickly after acts of hate, he is learning just the opposite: that a statement made after a long pause allows him to have his cake and eat it too.\n\nIt\u2019s a three-step process:\n\nFirst, something terrible happens, and people demand the president condemn it or make some sort of statement.\n\nSecond, the president does not respond. This silence does not commit him to one position or the other. However, as more and more people call for him to say something in particular, expectations for him to speak grow. As a result, the silence is increasingly understood as a \u201cturn,\u201d rather than the absence of one\u2014and that turn is taken to communicate tacit approval of the opposite stance.\n\nThird, the president eventually speaks up to decry whatever he\u2019s being asked to decry. The delay provides plausible deniability. In response to too-little-too-late critiques, he\u2019s able to say that after we asked him to speak up, he did. What more could we want? And yet the doubt communicated in the silence remains, allowing him to appease those who did not want him to speak up in the first place.\n\nSilence is a powerful tool in Trump\u2019s plausible deniability toolkit. But those of us who oppose him have our own powerful tools: We can continue to hold him accountable for his silences, even after he finally speaks.\n\nLearn how to write for Quartz Ideas.
