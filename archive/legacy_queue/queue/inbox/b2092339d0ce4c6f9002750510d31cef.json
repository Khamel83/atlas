      "Title": "Kerry has finally decided to take no for an answer why he gave his big Israel speech Vox - All",
      "Selection": "The last week of 2016 has been unexpectedly momentous for US-Israeli \u2014 and US-Palestinian \u2014 relations. First, the Obama administration decided to abstain on a United Nations Security Council vote on a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory. The international community has long considered the building of Israeli settlements on Palestinian land both illegal under international law and an impediment to the eventual creation of a Palestinian state. The US\u2019s refusal to veto allowed the resolution to pass, rebuking right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s pro-settlement policies and infuriating him and his office.\n\nThen on Wednesday, outgoing Secretary of State John Kerry delivered a lengthy speech further castigating the Netanyahu government and warning that its policies threaten the future viability of a two-state solution.\n\nI spoke that afternoon with Matthew Duss, the president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace and a leading observer on issues relating to the Israel-Palestine conflict and US policy toward both actors. We talked about the strategic thinking behind the administration\u2019s renewed push against Israeli settlements, what it means for the incoming Trump administration and for Israeli domestic politics, and more. The transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nDylan Matthews\n\nWhy is this happening now, with Obama headed out the door and a new administration that appears significantly more sympathetic to Netanyahu coming in? Why does the Obama administration think this is a good time to make this move?\n\nMatthew Duss\n\nI think there are couple reasons. One is a sincere sense of urgency about the possibility of a two-state solution being lost. In December 2015, at the Saban Forum, Kerry premiered a really detailed set of critiques of Israeli policies in the West Bank \u2014 home demolitions, expropriation of land, refusal of construction permits for Palestinians \u2014 a whole menu of things the Israelis were doing that showed they were actually consolidating and entrenching the occupation, rather than preparing to end it.\n\nKerry noted this raised serious questions about Israel\u2019s commitment to a two-state solution. Over the following year, he and a whole number of other administration officials \u2014 UN Ambassador Samantha Power, Ambassador to Israel Daniel Shapiro \u2014 have made very similar critiques, making all of the same points, saying that the Israelis are doing things in the West Bank that are completely contradictory to what they say their goal is. There is no way to reconcile the goal of a two-state solution with these policies.\n\nIt was always framed as a question: \u201cExplain to us how this is consistent with your stated goal.\u201d I think it was clear they didn\u2019t want to just come out and say, \u201cYou are no longer committed to a two-state solution.\u201d\n\nBut I think what we saw today is that Kerry, after a year of raising these questions, has finally decided to take no for an answer, at least from this Israeli government, noting that this Israeli government is a very right-wing government; it\u2019s a government that is completely committed to the settlement project. Prime Minister Netanyahu has bragged that his government is more committed to the settlements than any Israeli government in history.\n\nThat partly explains why the US felt it had to take these steps now. The other part of it is that you have this incoming administration that\u2019s signaled in various ways \u2014 up to and including the choice of ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, who\u2019s a very right-wing, pro-settlement, anti-two-state person, who has called the two-state solution an \u201cillusion\u201d \u2014 that they\u2019re not going to be committed to this goal, and will just allow the Israelis to keep doing what they\u2019re doing, undermining the possibility of a two-state solution. Kerry and the administration saw some real value in reaffirming the international consensus around what a final resolution of this conflict would look like, or should look like.\n\nMoshe Milner/GPO via Getty Images\nObama\u2019s 2013 speech in Jerusalem.\nDylan Matthews\n\nWho was the main audience for this speech? Was it a last-minute pitch to Netanyahu? Other Israeli policymakers? Palestinian leadership?\n\nMatthew Duss\n\nAs in most cases, there were multiple audiences. First and foremost, there\u2019s the American people. This is the secretary of state explaining to the American people why their government is devoting energy and attention to this issue in this way. I think they did a good job of that, reiterating that this is a consistent policy going back several administrations. Opposition to settlements has been the position of every single US government since the occupation began. The two-state solution has been a consensus solution in American politics for many years.\n\nThere\u2019s the Israeli audience. President Obama has reached out to the Israeli people a number of times, including when he traveled to Israel and gave that famous speech where he envisioned a better future for Israelis and Palestinians, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s up to you to work together and create this better future.\u201d\n\nWhat we saw from Kerry today was slightly different, saying, \u201cYour government is doing this. We, the United States, will continue to support you, and we remain committed to your security and your legitimacy. These things are not in question. But we do not and cannot and will not support the continued building of the settlements and undermining of the two-state solution.\u201d \n\nThat distinction is one of the most important things to come out of the events of the past week, including the UN Security Council resolution, this making of a distinction between support for Israel\u2019s security and legitimacy on the one hand, and opposition to Israel\u2019s settlements and occupation on the other, and a refusal to conflate those two things.\n\nDylan Matthews\n\nOne of the more striking things about Kerry\u2019s speech was his choice of language \u2014 referring to the expulsion of Palestinians following the 1948 war as the \u201cNakba,\u201d the Arabic term for \u201ccatastrophe\u201d or \u201cdisaster\u201d that Palestinians use to describe the event \u2014 and characterizing the status of Palestinians under occupation as \u201cseparate but unequal.\u201d How significant was that?\n\nMatthew Duss\n\nI think the reference to \u201cseparate but unequal\u201d was very significant. This is something that resonates with American history. It was a clear reference to American segregation. When we\u2019re talking about the various audiences, that is something Americans understand, and hearing a high American official describe the reality of the occupation that way I think is new, and entirely accurate.\n\nI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever heard a high US official talk about the Nakba like that. Obama\u2019s [2009] Cairo speech was important because he spoke about the Palestinian narrative and Israeli narrative together, as two peoples with claims to this land, but I don\u2019t think we saw anything close to as explicit and forthright a recognition of the Palestinian narrative and the reality of Palestinian suffering that we saw from Secretary Kerry.\n\nAbir Sultan- Pool/Getty Images\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (center) attends Shimon Peres\u2019s funeral.\nDylan Matthews\n\nOne critique of both the UN non-veto and the Kerry speech that I\u2019ve seen from people sympathetic to the two-state solution and normally critical of Netanyahu is that while it is undoubtedly true that the settlement enterprise is unjust and the Netanyahu government is not at all committed to peace, it doesn\u2019t accomplish a whole lot for the US to make that point in this way, and that it could backfire and strengthen Netanyahu and other hard-liners in Israel. What do you make of that argument?\n\nMatthew Duss\n\nI think it\u2019s totally fair to ask what actual effect this has on the ground. The answer is probably very little. The Israelis were building settlements before, and they\u2019ll most likely go ahead and continue building settlements now. What\u2019s significant here \u2014 in both [Kerry\u2019s speech] but also the resolution last week \u2014 is that we\u2019ve seen an effort, a very aggressive effort over the past few years by Netanyahu, of normalizing the settlements, of just saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal, we\u2019re going to keep doing this, and eventually the world will give up, they\u2019ll just accept it.\u201d\n\nWhat we saw last week and we saw again [in Kerry\u2019s speech] was that\u2019s just not true. This is part of what has created such an outraged reaction from Netanyahu, in addition to the fact that he may be in some severe legal trouble very soon and wants to distract from it. Netanyahu had led this effort to normalize the settlements. If you listen to [Netanyahu and his allies], they seem to believe they had successfully chipped away at the international consensus that settlements are illegal. Last Friday was a wake-up call, and they\u2019re not happy about it.\n\nThere is value in reaffirming that international consensus, and the message that that sends not only to Israelis but also to Palestinians. This is an important achievement for Palestinian diplomacy and Palestinian nonviolence. One of the things undermining the Palestinian Authority, the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO], [President] Mahmoud Abbas, and the rest of the Palestinian leadership that has embraced nonviolence, is that they have very little to show for years of these efforts. To be able to go back to the Palestinian people and say, \u201cListen, we have a UN Security Council resolution that says what we have been saying and endorsed our position,\u201d I think that\u2019s very significant.\n\nDylan Matthews\n\nOn that point \u2014 I was struck that Mustafa Barghouti, one of the Palestinian politicians most firmly committed to nonviolence and the peace process, responded to the speech by praising the overall message but arguing that Kerry\u2019s comments on the right of return (implying that Palestinians dislocated in 1948 wouldn\u2019t be allowed to return to their ancestral homes in Israel), Jerusalem, and the status of Israel as a Jewish state were \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Obviously the reception from Netanyahu was going to be chilly, but does it worry you that moderate Palestinian leaders were critical?\n\nMatthew Duss\n\nI think the fact that both sides don\u2019t like parts of it is a good sign. Both sides are going to have to make some tough concessions and tough choices. Neither side is going to get all of what they want.\n\nThis is often forgotten, and it should not be, but when the PLO recognized Israel in 1993 in an exchange of letters between [Israeli Prime Minister] Yitzhak Rabin and [PLO Chair] Yasser Arafat, and relinquished its claim on 78 percent of Palestine and accepted the idea of a Palestinian state on the remaining 22 percent, that was the biggest concession that either side has made, or will make, in this conflict. That\u2019s kind of lost to history at this point, but it\u2019s very important to remember that. That was an enormous concession that was made at the outset of the Oslo process.\n\nIn return for that concession, Israel didn\u2019t recognize a Palestinian state; it only recognized the PLO\u2019s right to negotiate on behalf of Palestinians. There was clear disparity there.\n\nWhat we saw today was Kerry was offering an American position that basically said the Palestinians will need to relinquish the full right of return. He didn\u2019t offer specifics, he said it does need to be negotiated, but he did put the American government behind the idea that the vast majority of Palestinian refugees would have to return to the state of Palestine rather than the state of Israel. That is another enormous concession for the Palestinians. That would be the second biggest concession that either side has, or will have, to make in this conflict.\n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s a tough one for the Palestinians to take. In my own conversations with Palestinian leaders, none of them downplays the importance of the right of return. That is a very central component of Palestinian identity and the Palestinian narrative, and it happens to be an internationally recognized right.\n\nBut I do think a big part of this is acknowledgment of the expulsion, acknowledgment of the Nakba, that this thing happened, that Palestinians were driven out of their homes; they did not simply decide to run away one day for no reason. This was a policy that was undertaken. I don\u2019t claim to speak for Palestinians in any sense, but just from my own conversations, it\u2019s clear that recognition of the creation of the refugee problem and the processes that went into that are nearly as important as the idea that these rights would be implemented.\n\nBrendan Smialowski/Getty Images\nTrump\u2019s secretary of state nominee and Kerry\u2019s likely successor, Rex Tillerson.\nDylan Matthews\n\nHow easy will the initiative, both in the UN and in Kerry\u2019s speech, be to undo? You do have a wholly new administration coming in with very different views on Israel. How quickly can they do a 180?\n\nMatthew Duss\n\nIn the case of the UN Security Council resolution, unless Trump is going to produce a new resolution rescinding it and gets all of the members of the Security Council to vote for it, that is binding. That\u2019s something he can\u2019t change.\n\nTrump is going to create his own policy toward Israel, toward Palestine. One of the reasons for giving this speech now is to lay out this vision but also put it in the context of a rather overwhelming international consensus, and say, \u201cThis is the international consensus vision for how this conflict gets resolved,\u201d to plant a flag here and make it clear that if and when Trump departs from this consensus, it is a departure. The speech today illustrated how the Israeli policy deviated from that consensus, and how that has exacerbated this challenge. I think the speech made it clear that efforts to move beyond that or outside that consensus are problematic.\n\nDylan Matthews\n\nWhat do you think the effect will be on centrist and left parties in Israel, ones that could conceivably lead a pro-peace government capable of a last-ditch push for a final deal in the future, after Netanyahu\u2019s gone?\n\nMatthew Duss\n\nYou saw a tweet from Isaac Herzog, the leader of opposition, the leader of the Labor Party, praising Secretary Kerry as a friend of Israel. It was clearly meant as a rebuttal to Netanyahu and his gang\u2019s attacks on the US and Kerry specifically over the past few days, which have been very ugly. \n\nAs for how they exploit this, I think we\u2019ve seen in the past few days since the UN Security Council vote, they\u2019ve gone after Netanyahu. He\u2019s promoted himself as a master diplomat, saying, \u201cLook at all the friends we\u2019re making, we\u2019re working on other stuff, the Palestinians aren\u2019t a problem anymore, no one cares\u201d \u2014 and you have this 14-0 UN Security Council vote last week that says, \u201cNo, that\u2019s completely wrong.\u201d\n\nSo they\u2019ve been saying, \u201cNetanyahu as the master diplomatic tactician, that was all incorrect.\u201d But we haven\u2019t seen a great deal of skill from the Israeli opposition over the past few years in terms of capitalizing on situations like this, so I\u2019m not really optimistic.",
