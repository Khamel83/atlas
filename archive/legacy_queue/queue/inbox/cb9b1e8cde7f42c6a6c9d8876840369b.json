      "Selection": "In 2013, Foursquare co-founder Dennis Crowley walked into a bakery and bought a cake. Almond, with meringue on top. It was sweet\u2014but the milestone was sweeter.\n\nFor more than a decade\u2014since his grad school days\u2014he\u2019d been pursuing one big idea: a product that understands how users move through the world so well, it can deliver timely, personalized tips. That idea had evolved through several iterations, from a startup called Dodgeball to the founding of Foursquare.\n\nWhen he bought the cake, the company best known for \u201cchecking in\u201d was several years into something bigger, developing mobile software that would recognize users\u2019 locations and automatically push tailored recommendations.\n\nOne of the developers gave Crowley a phone with a new build and told him to go for a walk with it. The Foursquare founder went down the street towards Little Cupcake Bakeshop. The phone lit up and pinged him to let him know he was near the bakery and what people like to get there. On the list? The dreaming princess cake.\n\nIt had worked: the phone knew where Crowley was and offered useful information, without any input from him. Needless to say, there was dreaming princess cake for everyone in the office that afternoon.\n\nThat game-changing moment would be followed by a thousand mini-breakthroughs: cutting the time it took for the phone to ping, for example, or better distinguishing between two neighboring stores. \u201cThose changes are harder to notice,\u201d says Crowley. \u201cThe moment it goes from not working to working is the big moment.\u201d\n\nIn this exclusive interview, he urges founders to think audaciously, and to push toward their own big moments. Crowley examines six facets to tenacity and how each can drive a company forward differently. He shares advice for how to pursue an idea for the long haul\u2014and, as importantly, how to inspire and mobilize the rest of your team to care about it, too.\n\nTenacity as identity\n\nThe germ of tenacity can be as much about a great idea as one\u2019s self-identification with it. \u201cSometimes you just have to build it to prove to yourself that it works or doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s as much about if and why it works, as your agency in it,\u201d says Crowley.\n\nTake his first experiment, Dodgeball. The initial version was essentially just a city guide, wherein users could write reviews of places they\u2019d been. This was around 2000; the guide wasn\u2019t mobile, and crowdsourced content was still relatively unheard of. In fact, everyone in the space told him it couldn\u2019t work\u2014editors were necessary for a reason. \u201cPeople said it\u2019s a bad idea,\u201d says Crowley. \u201cI lulled myself into thinking the same. It\u2019s not going to work. So we didn\u2019t build it.\u201d\n\nSo what changed? Quite simply, this product was something Crowley himself wanted to use. The idea stuck in his mind, needling him, and he had to see if it could work. \u201cTo build it was almost like fulfilling a need to express myself. So that was the project I learned how to code for. I taught myself out of one of those big \u2018Learn to Code in 30 Days\u2019 books,\u201d he says, \u201cPersonally, it was fulfilling. Externally, it wasn\u2019t a huge success. A couple of thousand people used it.\u201d\n\nBut it laid the groundwork for Dodgeball Version 2.0, the prevailing version when Crowley founded a company by the same name in 2004. \u201cI was on the product and engineering team of Vindigo at the time, and we would say, wouldn\u2019t it be crazy if you could see where all of your friends had been? You wouldn\u2019t have to read the reviews\u2014you could just go to the places they\u2019d been.\u201d\n\nAgain there were naysayers, and again Crowley knew he needed to see if it could be done the way he would do it\u2014and if anyone else wanted to use it. \u201cI wanted this thing to exist. I thought, It doesn\u2019t seem like anyone else is going to build this, so I\u2019ll go build it.\u201d\n\nAround that time, as fate would have it, Crowley and several of his friends were laid off. \u201cWe were trying to find each other around the city,\u201d he said. They had a need, and the time and skill-set to meet it. \u201cWe wanted a way that you could just check in at an East Village bar and that\u2019s how you would know to go find someone. Looking back the idea was there, we just needed a community to form around it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0If, after several turns in your career and life, you return to the same idea, pursue it. Your creation is as much an act of self-expression at that point. \u00a0\n\nDodgeball introduced the world to the concept of \u201cchecking in,\u201d and it turned out, lots of other people wanted it. \u201cI thought, \u2018If only ten of my friends use this, it\u2019s fine because it helped us.\u2019 We found that if you can build something that you\u2019re interested in and your ten friends are really into, there\u2019s a good chance that their ten friends will be into it, and their friends as well,\u201d says Crowley. \u201cMy lesson is that you\u2019ll need more than yourself eventually, but not much more. Don\u2019t give up until you can go after it with at least ten friends.\u201d\n\nSoon, more than ten friends became interested. Crowley teamed up with Alex Rainert at NYU, where he started to refine the idea. Dodgeball went from a side project to a full-blown thesis. Google took note, too, and bought Dodgeball in 2005. A couple of years later, though, Crowley was itching to take his idea further.\n\nTenacity as confidence (tempered with humility)\n\nEven after achieving success\u2014Dodgeball\u2019s sale to Google, Foursquare\u2019s buzzed-about debut at 2009\u2019s SXSW\u2014Crowley encountered resistance.\n\nBut one key ingredient of tenacity? Persistence. \u201cWhen we pitched Foursquare to investors, the feedback universally was \u2018You already made this and you already sold it. Google ultimately didn\u2019t want it and it didn\u2019t work. Why would I ever invest in you doing the same thing again?\u2019\u201d recounts Crowley.\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t the same thing. In just a few years, phones had changed dramatically, as had the ways people engaged online and with their social networks. But just as you need to believe in your idea enough to build it, you need to believe enough to sell it\u2014even if you yourself aren\u2019t sure where you\u2019re going to end up.\n\n\u201cWe knew from Dodgeball that if we got a bunch of people checking in, there was really interesting trends at work in that data. We didn\u2019t know the full extent of what Foursquare would become years later, but we knew there was something buried in the data,\u201d says Crowley. \u201cAnd we know the idea of checking in, especially when combined with game mechanics, would get people to give us the data.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t confuse confidence in your mission with hubris, though. There will still be expert outside voices who can see things you don\u2019t. When you find trustworthy counsel, listen to what they have to say.\n\nFor Crowley, that came in the form of venture capitalist Charlie O\u2019Donnell, who was able to see the winning pitch for Foursquare before its founders could. \u201cWe were out there describing how we would build a personalized guide to the world from all our data. As we were pitching, Charlie wrote a blog post called \u2018Why Yelp \u2014 and every single retail establishment\u2014should support Foursquare.\u2019\u201d With a little distance, O\u2019Donnell could see the story that investors and merchants would respond to. \u201cHis was a very clear articulation of what Foursquare offers. It\u2019s this force that drives people to places. They check in. Merchants see that, and offer specials to encourage more check-ins. There\u2019s an ecosystem there.\u201d\n\nCrowley and his team understood that ecosystem, of course, but couldn\u2019t take their eyes off the endgame. \u201cWe were like, \u2018No! Personalized guide! Personalized guide!\u2019 It took conversations with investors before we really realized what the story could be at that point. There was money to be made with merchants and with the data that helped them understand where consumers were going and what they liked. Once we started to understand the storyline that investors found compelling, we combined it with the narrative that we had crafted on our own. That\u2019s when it turned into something real.\u201d\n\nTenacity as focus\n\nIn the commotion of launching a company, though, it can be hard to distinguish between wise voices and noise, between the ideas that move you forward and the ones that sidetrack you.\n\nCrowley\u2019s advice to founders is to articulate\u2014and then frequently check-in with\u2014their North Star. How to do that? \u201cKeep asking: \u2018what\u2019s this supposed to be when it grows up?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had an orienting grand vision, sometimes to a fault: build products that generate information about where people are going and use that data to create products that make it easier for them to navigate the real world.\u201d\n\nBut there was a moment, Crowley now recalls, when he and his cofounders thought they should perhaps pivot to being \u201cthe check-in-to-everything company.\u201d It was 2010, and new imitators were cropping up every day, applying Foursquare\u2019s concept to anything from events to meals. \u201cThere was this whole movement: you\u2019ll check into TV shows and check into articles. We laugh at it now, but we thought, Should we do that?\u201d\n\nCrowley and his team kept their eye on their North Star and avoided deviating down that and any number of other distracting paths. \u201cYou have to ask yourself, is what we\u2019re supposed to be in ten years? Are these the products that we\u2019re destined to create ten years from now? You have to have a clear opinion of what you\u2019re doing or what you\u2019re not doing. You have to trust your gut sometimes and say, \u2018This keeps us on the path more than this would.\u2019\u201d\n\nStaying on the right path is not simply about making major decisions thoughtfully; it\u2019s not a once-a-year agenda item for the company offsite. \u201cIt\u2019s a series of decisions that get made every day,\u201d says Crowley. \u201cThat\u2019s because new factors in the form of data, market shifts, competitors, advisors\u2014you name it\u2014change the set of information you use to make decisions at any one point in time. The only way to keep focus is to continue to ask yourself: what\u2019s this supposed to be when it grows up? You\u2019ll either explain or rationalize your answer. That\u2019ll help guide you.\u201d\n\nUp until 2013, for example, Foursquare gave its API away for free, even to the Fortune 500 companies who were using it\u2014then an investor pointed out that that was crazy. \u201cWe thought people would switch to something else if we charged for it. It turns out when we started calling up the companies that were using the API most aggressively, they said, \u2018Of course we\u2019re going to pay for this. We\u2019re actually wondering why you didn\u2019t call us six months ago asking to be paid.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe team put together the requisite pricing plans and sales strategies and began selling their API. And in so doing, their eyes were opened to a world of new data products they could develop. In fact, in recent years, Foursquare has dedicated growing resources to enterprise sales of those products.\n\nBut how can you tell the difference between a distraction from your mission and a pivot that will enhance it? It all comes back to the crucial guidance of that North Star. \u201cWe always said, \u2018Build the stuff that makes the real world easier to use,\u2019\u201d says Crowley. \u201cIf you\u2019ve chosen the right mission\u2014if, crucially, it\u2019s something that excites you\u2014your own reaction to new ideas will be telling.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, these were tough decisions for Crowley back then. The signals in the industry told him Foursquare should be big and be competitive. Almost weekly, he had conversations like this:\n\nCrowley: \u201cI\u2019m the founder and I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\n\nSomeone else: \u201cBut, that\u2019s what everyone else is doing.\u201d\n\nCrowley: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\n\nIn hindsight, Crowley can laugh about it and say it was such an easy decision. But it wasn\u2019t. It was taxing.\n\nThere will always be distractions, big and small. As a founder, your responsibility is to stay mission-focused. \u201cI think about those early Facebook stories. They had so much success, and so many distractions\u2014Yahoo! trying to buy them for a billion dollars. The response from Mark Zuckerberg from that time is something like, \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to have an idea this good again.\u2019 That, I think, sums it up.\u201d\n\nTenacity as grit\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that bringing your big idea to the world will happen overnight, and having a mission you believe in will only become more important when you hit the inevitable slogs. Reflecting on his own decade-long journey, Crowley identified a few key principles that will help founders endure for the long haul:\n\nDon\u2019t wait for someone else to build it. A lot of startups begin with a good idea that no one else has run with yet. That kind of initiative should remain a part of your company\u2019s DNA, long after your seed round recedes into company history. And don\u2019t be afraid to punch above your weight.\n\nFor years, Crowley had imagined technology that would know where a user had been without being told. Once someone delivered that, he thought, he\u2019d make even better, smarter services. Until that day, Foursquare\u2019s app would just use manual check-ins as a workaround.\n\n\u201cIn 2011, we were waiting for other companies, Google and Apple, to build that technology. It would be able to tell you, the developer, or tell your app where it was, which store or restaurant it was in. I thought that was going to be baked into the iPhone 4S with iOS 5. Those were the signals that we were getting from Apple with all the geo-fencing that they were launching,\u201d says Crowley. \u201cI remember we watched the keynote. We got the phone and we played with it. And we said, \u2018this doesn\u2019t do what it\u2019s supposed to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat moment was an epiphany for Crowley: You can\u2019t wait for another company to make the technology you need to build what you\u2019re destined to build. You must develop it yourself.\n\nFrom that day, Crowley and his team set about learning how to develop the platform they needed to move forward on their revenue-generating plans. It took years. \u201cThere were moments when our board would say, \u2018this thing doesn\u2019t work. Is it ever going to work? We invested a lot of money into getting this thing working. When will it work?\u2019 And the answer was: \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 It was a harder problem than anyone thought it was. It required more engineers and data scientists, which we didn\u2019t have before. There was nothing for us to copy. We were building it from scratch.\u201d\n\nWhat he didn\u2019t tell the board was that he wasn\u2019t always sure it was ever going to work. \u201cYou know what the end goal is. You know the stakes are high, and that there\u2019s good reward for doing it,\u201d says Crowley. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing that keeps you doing it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0But that\u2019s the thing about tenacity: sometimes you have to make the big bet, say it out loud, then throw yourself in so there\u2019s no going back. \u00a0\n\nFoursquare\u2019s technology embodies tenacity, even down to the name. The company called its location technology Pilgrim, to represent how important\u2014nearly sacred\u2014this mission was for the company, and how persistent it must be in its journey toward it. \u201cWhen we announced Pilgrim, I took a look back at all we accomplished. Personally it had been eight years working on Foursquare and more than a dozen immersed in location-based or contextual-aware services,\u201d says Crowley. \u201cThat\u2019s even before you get to the efforts of hundreds of people at Foursquare. But that\u2019s what it takes to build something\u2014like our Places API or Pilgrim SDK\u2014that can help thousands of developers or marketers. Tenacity over time has an exponential\u2014not a linear\u2014impact. But it takes dedication.\u201d\n\nTenacity as a culture\n\nAt the end of the day, tenacity needs to transcend the founder and become a core company value. Big ideas aren\u2019t brought to fruition single-handedly. Just as you\u2019ll devote your time to scaling operations, you need to scale tenacity, too.\n\nTalk about setbacks openly and honestly. Make it a habit to share the good and the bad. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard, but you can create a cadence. At an All Hands or weekly check-in, show two slides every week. One slide is about what\u2019s good, one slide is about what\u2019s bad. Build this into your process,\u201d says Crowley. \u201cWhatever the format, the goal is simply to ensure that the people building and selling your products understand what\u2019s going on with the company. Overemphasizing the positive becomes problematic. Some companies are just drinking their own Kool-Aid all the time. That\u2019s not helpful for anyone. You have to have a regular dosage of good news and bad news for self-awareness.\u201d\n\nSeed a culture of ingenuity. You developed your foundational idea with grit and focus. As you grow, you\u2019ll need to elevate lofty thinking as a company value and reward those who practice it, and you\u2019ll increase tenacity exponentially.\n\n\u201cWe have infused the company with that same shoot-for-the-moon spirit that started it. Now, a lot of the things that generate revenue for the company aren\u2019t my ideas. Someone pitched an advertising product that was loosely tied to Pilgrim, something that would help advertisers measure ad effectiveness. Another said we could predict the number of iPhone 6s that\u2019d be sold based on foot traffic data,\u201d says Crowley. \u201cThose were not my ideas. They\u2019re crazy. \u2018Has anyone ever done that?\u2019 No. \u2018Why don\u2019t you go do it?\u2019 All right. \u2018What do you need?\u2019 We\u2019ll get a couple of people to go work on it. \u2018Go do that and let me know how it works out.\u2019 That turns into a huge part of what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nHow, though, can you stay focused when lots of fresh minds are generating lots of fresh ideas? Ask yourself whether any new idea leverages your core idea. If it does, trust in it, even if it seems outlandish. That\u2019s how you honor the spirit of risk-taking that got you to where you are, without getting distracted.\n\n\u00a0If your core idea is your North Star, go ahead and build a constellation around it. Just avoid adding stars that\u2019ll shine alone in another galaxy\u2014they rarely get as bright.\u00a0\n\nTenacity as a private truth\n\nCasual observers probably don\u2019t know that the Foursquare team has been defining itself as a location intelligence company; indeed, many have kept judging the company by its consumer apps\u2019 usage metrics. \u201cThese days, we all know that we are creating a location tech company, built on the amazing work we do on the consumer side. But plenty of people on the outside world are like, \u2018I don\u2019t use your app anymore, therefore your company must be failing,\u2019\u201d says Crowley. \u201cSometimes people tell me they don\u2019t use the Foursquare app anymore and to that I say, \u2018Hey not a problem\u2014we have more than 50 million people around the world who do!\u2019 I think there\u2019s also a lot of people who touch Foursquare data everyday\u2014through our partnerships with Snapchat, Uber, Twitter, or Apple Maps\u2014without even knowing it. The company is performing well these days because of all the technology we\u2019ve built on top of all the data we have.\u201d\n\nAs a founder, you will likely find yourself, from time to time, sitting on business data or strategy that you can\u2019t yet share. That\u2019s not to say you shouldn\u2019t speak up when you can. Foursquare, for example, has been engaged in a significant campaign to educate people outside the company about its current priorities. \u201cIn the first three or four years of a company, though, you\u2019re not doing that,\u201d says Crowley. \u201cThe press is telling your story, the users are telling your story. Maybe you get on stage at a conference occasionally and talk about the great stuff that you\u2019re building.\u201d\n\nThen there are the even more frustrating middle years. That\u2019s when you\u2019re likely to be building the bigger, better things that will allow you to scale. And if you\u2019re like most companies, there are sure to be stretches when your killer new technology isn\u2019t working the way you wanted\u2014or is still just a glimmer in your eye.\n\nThat\u2019s the moment, Crowley says, to double down and stay true to your big idea. You might not be sending out press releases, but there\u2019s one audience you can and should be talking to: your team. \u201cAnswer every question that they might have about your product. Repeat what you\u2019re doing every week at the company meeting. Remind each other. Explain how you define success, and reinforce that internally. The world might not need to understand what you\u2019re up to yet, but they sure do.\u201d\n\nTying it together\n\nTenacity has many manifestations for founders and their startups. At the beginning, it\u2019s often deeply tied to identity. Giving up one\u2019s idea feels like giving up on oneself. After hitting early milestones, tenacity is confidence. But it\u2019s best tempered with humility, so as to avoid flying too high on early wins. As a company scales, tenacity is focus. There will be accompanying growing pains as customers sign up, headcount grows, and the market responds. Anchor and orient yourself by asking: what is this supposed to be when it grows up? When the going gets tough, tenacity is grit. Don\u2019t look externally to others to build what you need\u2014you\u2019ll be waiting longer than you want. Do it yourself. Lastly, tenacity is culture and a private truth. Tenacity at scale will both involve and elude people. What guides the team isn\u2019t always accurately reflected in the public\u2019s perception. An informed, committed team around you is the best way to drown out the noise and to march toward achieving your biggest goals.\n\n\u201cThese different facets of tenacity are important insofar as invoking them keeps your legs moving and charging forward. Growing a company is an impossibly hard endeavor\u2014many wouldn\u2019t start if they knew just how difficult it is,\u201d Crowley says. \u201cBut the early stories of most successful companies are often those in which no one thought it could be done. In fact, if you asked them, those founders probably didn\u2019t know if they could do it either. But if you can get there\u2014if you stick to what you set out to do\u2014it can put you in an amazingly powerful and defensible position.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published on First Round Review, read the original article.",
