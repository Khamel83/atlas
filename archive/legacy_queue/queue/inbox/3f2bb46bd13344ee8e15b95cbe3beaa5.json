      "Title": "The decoy effect is making you spend more money\u2014without realizing it Quartz",
      "Selection": "Price is the most delicate element of the marketing mix, and much thought goes into setting prices to nudge us towards spending more.\n\nThere\u2019s one particularly cunning type of pricing strategy that marketers use to get you to switch your choice from one option to a more expensive or profitable one.\n\nIt\u2019s called the decoy effect.\n\nImagine you are shopping for a Nutribullet blender. You see two options. The cheaper one, at $89, promotes 900 watts of power and a five-piece accessory kit. The more expensive one, at $149, is 1,200 watts and has 12 accessories.\n\nWhich one you choose will depend on some assessment of their relative value for money. It\u2019s not immediately apparent, though, that the more expensive option is better value. It\u2019s slightly less than 35% more powerful but costs nearly 70% more. It does have more than twice as many plastic accessories, but what are they worth?\n\nNow consider the two in light of a third option.\n\nThis one, for $125, offers 1,000 watts and nine accessories. It enables you to make what feels like a more considered comparison. For $36 more than the cheaper option, you get four more accessories and an extra 100 watts of power. But if you spend just $24 extra, you get a further three accessories and 200 watts more power. Bargain!\n\nYou have just experienced the decoy effect.\n\nAsymmetric dominance\n\nThe decoy effect is defined as the phenomenon whereby consumers change their preference between two options when presented with a third option\u2014the \u201cdecoy\u201d\u2014that is \u201casymmetrically dominated.\u201d It is also referred to as the \u201cattraction effect\u201d or \u201casymmetric dominance effect.\u201d\n\nWhat asymmetric domination means is the decoy is priced to make one of the other options much more attractive. It is \u201cdominated\u201d in terms of perceived value (quantity, quality, extra features, and so on). The decoy is not intended to sell, just to nudge consumers away from the \u201ccompetitor\u201d and towards the \u201ctarget\u201d\u2014usually the more expensive or profitable option.\n\nThe effect was first described by academics Joel Huber, John Payne, and Christopher Puto in a paper presented to a conference in 1981 (and later published in the Journal of Consumer Research in 1982).\n\nThey demonstrated the effect through experiments in which participants (university students) were asked to makes choices in scenarios involving beer, cars, restaurants, lottery tickets, films, and television sets.\n\nIn each product scenario participants first had to choose between two options. Then they were given a third option\u2014a decoy designed to nudge them toward picking the target over the competitor. In every case except the lottery tickets the decoy successfully increased the probability of the target being chosen.\n\nThese findings were, in marketing terms, revolutionary. They challenged established doctrines\u2014known as the \u201csimilarity heuristic\u201d and the \u201cregularity condition\u201d\u2014that a new product will take away market share from an existing product and cannot increase the probability of a customer choosing the original product.\n\nHow decoys work\n\nWhen consumers are faced with many alternatives, they often experience choice overload\u2014what psychologist Barry Schwartz has termed the tyranny or paradox of choice. Multiple behavioral experiments have consistently demonstrated that greater choice complexity increases anxiety and hinders decision-making.\n\nIn an attempt to reduce this anxiety, consumers tend to simplify the process by selecting only a couple of criteria (say price and quantity) to determine the best value for money.\n\nThrough manipulating these key choice attributes, a decoy steers you in a particular direction while giving you the feeling you are making a rational, informed choice.\n\nThe decoy effect is thus a form of \u201cnudging\u201d\u2014defined by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein (the pioneers of nudge theory) as \u201cany aspect of the choice architecture that alters people\u2019s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options.\u201d Not all nudging is manipulative, and some argue that even manipulative nudging can be justified if the ends are noble. It has proven useful in social marketing to encourage people to make good decisions such as using less energy, eating healthier, or becoming organ donors.\n\nIn the market\n\nWe see decoy pricing in many areas.\n\nA decade ago behavioral economist Dan Ariely spoke about his fascination with the pricing structure of The Economist and how he tested the options on 100 of his students.\n\nIn one scenario the students had a choice of a web-only subscription or a print-only subscription for twice the price; 68% chose the cheaper web-only option.\n\nThey were given a third option\u2014a web-and-print subscription for the same price as the print-only option. Now just 16% chose the cheaper option, with 84% opting for the obviously better combined option.\n\nIn this second scenario the print-only option had become the decoy and the combined option the target. Even The Economist was intrigued by Ariely\u2019s finding, publishing a story about it entitled \u201cThe importance of irrelevant alternatives.\u201d\n\nSubscription pricing for The Australian today replicates this \u201cirrelevant alternative\u201d, though in a slightly different way to the pricing architecture Ariely examined.\n\nWhy would you choose the digital-only subscription when you can get the weekend paper delivered for no extra cost?\n\nIn this instance, the digital-only option is the decoy and the digital+weekend paper option is the target. The intention appears to be to discourage you from choosing the more expensive six-day paper option. Because that option is not necessarily more profitable for the company. What traditionally made print editions profitable, despite the cost of printing and distribution, was the advertising they carried. That\u2019s no longer the case. It makes sense to encourage subscribers to move online.\n\nNot all decoys are so conspicuous. In fact the decoy effect may be extremely effective by being quite subtle.\n\nConsider the price of drinks at a well-known juice bar: a small (350 ml) size costs $6.10; the medium (450 ml) $7.10; and the large (610 ml) $7.50.\n\nWhich would you buy?\n\nIf you\u2019re good at doing maths in your head, or committed enough to use a calculator, you might work out that the medium is slightly better value than the small, and the large better value again.\n\nBut the pricing of the medium option\u2014$1 more than the small but just 40 cents cheaper than the large\u2014is designed to be asymmetrically dominated, steering you to see the biggest drink as the best value for money.\n\nSo have you just made the sensible choice, or been manipulated to spend more on a drink larger than you needed?\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
