      "Title": "Louis C.K. And The Rise Of The 'Laptop Loners'",
      "Selection": "C.K. neither attempts to present life as it actually is or to woo viewers with an upgraded, escapist approximation of it. Louie\u2019s New York can be both mimetic \u2014 the apartments are all appropriately small \u2014 and utterly fantastical: a severed head rolls down the street; a doctor tells you you\u2019re too out of shape to exercise; Matthew Broderick directs an all-Jewish remake of the Godfather. It\u2019s the New York of C.K.\u2019s imagination, the city inside his brain. Like Joyce\u2019s Dublin, it\u2019s sign-posted with recognizable locations, but sense-warped by its auteur\u2019s myopic subjectivity. And like a Bergman dream space, or the literal limitlessness of cyberspace, C.K.\u2019s nebulous New York is in a state of constant flux, blessed by FX with the freedom to be inconsistent even with itself.",
