      "Selection": "As designers, we're supposed to have sharper visual acuity than most of the population. I'm guessing most of you aced the previous two visual tests we posted about, Matthias Wandel's \"Eyeballing Game\" and the popular \"Which color doesn't fit?\" test.\n\nWell, here's another one, branded an \"OCD Test,\" and it's pretty fun. A sample question:\n\nTake the test here, and report back on your results. (There's no time limit on it, so if you don't get a perfect score, you can get the hell out of my classroom.)\n",
