How many clubs intend to deploy a flexible facsimile this spring? We\u00a0asked.\n\n(Getty Images/Ringer illustration)\n\nBaseball has always been a numbers game, but players and teams are getting smarter than ever\u200a\u2014\u200aand fans are, too. Throughout The Ringer\u2019s 2017 MLB preview, in a series we\u2019re calling \u201cHow to Baseball,\u201d our experts will explore the developments that stand to change the way the game is played and consumed. We\u2019ve never known more, and while knowledge is power, it\u2019s also a wellspring of questions. We hope to answer some of them\u200a\u2014\u200aand to remind you all to bunt wisely.\n\nThe more one reads about Indians fireman Andrew Miller, the more one suspects that being unselfish about saves, entering games at make-or-break moments, and alternating between warming up early or late must be the easy part of life as a precedent-setting reliever. The hard part is probably having to talk about the above.\n\nMiller\u2019s unique usage as a shutdown, multi-inning arm straight out of the \u201970s has made him a popular interview target for writers in search of baseball\u2019s latest trends. When I was working on a story late last August about Miller\u2019s work with Cleveland, an Indians PR person told me Miller wouldn\u2019t be available to talk about his unorthodox usage because he\u2019d already been asked about it so many times by local media members. (Instead, I talked to Terry Francona, who\u2019d probably been asked just as often.) That was, again, in August, more than a month before the playoffs drew 10 times the attention to Miller\u2019s exploits; we can only imagine how many more times Miller has been bombarded with bullpen questions since then. That\u2019s the hidden cost of becoming a trailblazer: People want to talk to you, and every one of them wants a fresh quote on a stale subject.\n\nEarlier this month, Miller was quoted in a Nick Cafardo feature for the Boston Globe called, \u201cWhy Andrew Miller could represent the future of relief pitching.\u201d At first, Miller downplays the idea thatbaseball may be \u201ctrending back toward the late-game, multi-inning relief ace,\u201d calling the response to his playoff performance \u201ca lot\u00a0\u2026 made out of a little.\u201d But then Cafardo coaxes a quote that seems to support the thesis.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see the multiple-innings reliever,\u201d Miller says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long it will take, we might be five years away from the 40-appearance, 80-inning reliever or something like that, but I can see it happening.\u201d\n\nCould it possibly be happening as soon as this spring? As Miller mentions to Cafardo, teams might have more success getting minor league bullpen guys to break free of their bonds than they would big leaguers with long-established routines. But the memory of Miller\u2019s October run, and the urge to emulate it, will never be stronger than now.\n\nSince the workhorse \u201970s, both innings pitched per relief appearance and the percentage of relief appearances lasting two innings or more have continued a decline that began immediately after baseball began, sinking most precipitously after the popularization of the Eckersley-La Russa cookie-cutter closer in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s.\n\nIn recent years, though, both rates have leveled off: Relievers have averaged about one inning per appearance, with roughly 10 percent of appearances lasting two-plus-innings. If Miller and Cafardo are right, that plateau could be a prelude to an upturn.\n\nBaseball\u2019s go-to public stat providers haven\u2019t processed spring training data in a way that would allow us to look for longer average outings this year than in spring trainings past, but there are some anecdotal indicators that suggest something afoot. On a podcast last week, Sun Sentinel Marlins beat writer Tim Healey told me and Jeff Sullivan that \u201cunconventional use\u201d of the bullpen is something Don Mattingly\u2019s team \u201ctalked about throughout the offseason,\u201d partly as a means of compensating for a thin starting staff. Healey also mentioned that the Marlins \u201csee [David Phelps] as their Andrew Miller\u2013type.\u201d Which made me wonder: How many \u201cMiller-types\u201d are there?\n\nThe 20 Baseball Players You Need to Watch in 2017From Francisco Lindor to Manny Machado, these guys play the game the right way\u200a\u2014\u200athe entertaining waytheringer.com\n\nTo find out, I surveyed one or more beat writers from each of the 28 other non-Indians teams and asked them if there\u2019s a particular pitcher on the club that they cover who\u2019s gotten buzz in camp about being a flexible, multi-inning reliever in the Miller mold\u200a\u2014\u200ain role, if not necessarily results. (Miller\u2019s stuff and stats are even rarer than his willingness to work without a predictable pattern.)\n\nThe table below contains the survey results. If the writer reported that the club does have at least one pitcher who\u2019s likely to start the season in a Miller-like role, I listed him in the first column. If the team has a pitcher (or pitchers) who might eventually slide into a role that in some way mirrors Miller\u2019s (in the writer\u2019s estimation), I filled in the second column. If both columns are blank, either the team follows strict inning assignments or its bullpen is still too unsettled to say whether there\u2019s a wannabe Miller lurking somewhere inside.\n\nThis table is just a snapshot of where teams stand as Opening Day approaches. Most teams\u2019 bullpens will reshape themselves significantly over the next six months, as injuries strike, prospects are promoted, and pitchers excel or struggle. After all, when last season started, the only Andrew Miller on the Indians was the SVP of strategy and business analytics. The one we\u2019ve been talking about was a conventional late-inning reliever closing (and subsequently setting up) for the Yankees.\n\nAll told, about a third of teams (including the Indians) have a pitcher who\u2019s currently slated to approximate a Miller-like role, although not necessarily in direct response to Miller\u2019s heroics last year.\n\nPhelps may be the most Miller-like of all, drawing explicit comparisons from Mattingly, who\u2019s called him \u201ckind of our Andrew Miller.\u201d Pitching almost exclusively in relief last year, Phelps saw his velocity spike almost 3.5 mph, with a correspondingly large increase in strikeout rate. Although he averaged just barely more than an inning per appearance out of the pen, he entered games as early as the fourth and as late as the ninth. Mattingly has described his position on the 2017 team as a \u201cdefined, undefined role\u201d in which his task could be \u201ca couple innings, it could be closing a game out\u200a\u2014\u200aanywhere in there depending on where our [bullpen is] at.\u201d Although Phelps still hoped to rejoin the rotation last spring, he\u2019s said that he\u2019s content this time to reprise the role that Miller made sexy.\n\nThe Rebirth of Baseball\u2019s Great CommunicatorCleveland\u2019s Terry Francona is innovating\u200a\u2014\u200aand eating\u200a\u2014\u200alike never beforetheringer.com\n\nThe Astros\u2019 Devenski is an actual example of the almost mythical 40-appearance, 80-inning reliever Miller invoked in his quote to Cafardo. Their origin stories don\u2019t look much alike: Miller, a sixth overall draft pick, was once ranked the 10th-best prospect in baseball by Baseball America; Devenski, a 771st overall pick, never made a top 100 and was left unprotected in the Rule 5 draft. Yet as a 25-year-old rookie last season with no prior experience above Double-A, Devenski was one of the best pitchers in baseball on a per-inning basis. As Sullivan has observed, only Clayton Kershaw and Kyle Hendricks recorded better park- and league-adjusted ERAs.\n\nDevenski, who finished fourth in rookie of the year voting, made 43 appearances out of the pen, totaling 83.2 innings. That made him the first 40-something/80-something bullpen pitcher since White Sox reliever Tony Pe\u00f1a, a sub-replacement pitcher in 2010. Devenski ditched his curve for an increasingly nasty slider as the season wore on, and his fastball played up in the pen, where he\u2019ll likely remain unless the Astros suffer enough injuries for him to be pressed into service as a starter.\n\nIt\u2019s not only new blood getting in on the act. Shortly after the World Series ended\u200a\u2014\u200aand days after a prescient Viva El Birdos blog post entitled \u201cTrevor Rosenthal as Andrew Miller\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aCardinals manager Mike Matheny called deposed closer Trevor Rosenthal to tell him to prepare to stretch out for more extended outings, and GM John Mozeliak told Derrick Goold that \u201cit makes sense to have people prepared to do more than just a one-inning stint.\u201d\n\nNor is Miller-like experimentation limited to competitive teams. Union-Tribune Padres beat writer Dennis Lin says that Padres reliever Brad Hand \u201chas been talked about\u201d as a candidate to mimic the Miller role. Conveniently, Hand, who led all relievers in innings and appearances last season, throws a close replica of Miller\u2019s slider. Meanwhile, the Reds came into camp with a long-gestating plan to use former starters Raisel Iglesias and Michael Lorenzen as \u201calternating, multi-inning closers\u201d who\u2019d pile up even more outings than Miller and Cleveland quasi-closer Cody Allen. The plan has hit some hurdles\u200a\u2014\u200aIglesias has missed much of March after falling in the shower, and Lorenzen has pitched poorly enough that he might wish he\u2019d slipped too\u200a\u2014\u200abut even if it doesn\u2019t pan out, the Reds had the desire to do something different.\n\nIn Arlington, multiple innings are in the air, although there\u2019s no designated fireman. \u201cIt seems like [Jeff] Banister is testing the waters on a lot of guys doing [the Miller role],\u201d says Levi Weaver, who covers the Rangers for WFAA, via direct message. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s less making one guy that guy, and\u200a\u2014\u200aaside from [Sam] Dyson\u200a\u2014\u200apushing that versatility aspect as a bullpen-wide trait.\u201d Matt Bush and Keone Kela have had a few multiple-inning outings this spring, which leads Weaver to believe that is \u201csomething Banister is intrigued by.\u201d Even Angels manager Mike Scioscia, who usually prefers rigid roles, has eschewed them this spring in favor of flexibility, although some of his multi-inning options\u200a\u2014\u200aBud Norris comes to mind\u200a\u2014\u200amight not be great fits for even one inning of work. Meanwhile, in Washington, Blake Treinen could still be a conventional closer, but as The Washington Post\u2019s Chelsea Janes says, \u201cI think if he isn\u2019t the closer, it will be because they want to make him Miller-y.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, perhaps, we\u2019re seeing what we want or expect to: After Miller mania, anything out of the ordinary can look like revolution. As Miller told Cafardo, no pitcher could withstand the workload he endured in October (19.1 innings in 15 team games) over the full summer schedule, so a reversal of the long-term, league-wide trend in the regular season is likely to come slowly, if at all. Still, there are some stirrings on the bullpen flexibility front this spring. We\u2019ll soon see whether they last long enough to move the major league needle.\n",
