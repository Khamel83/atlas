      "Title": "5 Reasons to Add Athens to Your Travel Plans The Points Guy",
      "Selection": "Athens is in the midst of a renaissance, with\u00a0a slew of trendy restaurants and bars livening up the city center, giving the capital\u00a0a much-needed Grecian gastronomic element\u00a0despite the recession. Yet\u00a0Greece\u2019s capital \u2014 and largest city \u2014 is often seen as a stopover en route to the islands in the summertime with most tourists overlooking one of the world\u2019s oldest cities and birthplace of democracy in favor of flashy beach clubs on the islands.\n\nI was once among them. Greece has been on my list of must-visit places for years, but when I finally decided to head to the homeland of part of my family, I immediately thought not of the capital\u00a0but of the thousands of islands to choose from. Santorini? Paros? Crete? That\u2019s when a friend living in Athens stepped in and asked why the city wasn\u2019t part of the plan \u2014 I went and ended up falling head over heels during the week I spent there. Here\u2019s why you should go, too,\u00a0and where to eat, drink and shop around Athens in between all that magnificent sightseeing.\n\n1. The Long Hauls From North America Are Easy\n\nLiving in Nice, I had a tricky time making my way to Athens, connecting through Frankfurt (FRA) on Lufthansa, but there are plenty of nonstop\u00a0flights into Athens International Airport (ATH) from the US and Canada. United flies nonstop from Newark (EWR) and Delta flies from New York (JFK), while American Airlines offers flights from Philadelphia International Airport (PHL). Things don\u2019t really heat up (both tourist- and weather-wise) until July, so you\u2019ll have less time to wait in lines at landmarks like the Acropolis then. And speaking of the Acropolis\u2026\n\nImage courtesy of Juan Salmoral via Flickr.\n2. The Acropolis Rocks!\n\nWith news of Greece\u2019s flailing economy continuously making headlines, it\u2019s easy to forget what the country is actually known for, like\u00a0the Parthenon. If you\u2019re staying around Syntagma Square or Plaka, the historical neighborhood, you\u2019re in prime walking distance of this historic site. The former temple dates back to 447 BC and offers\u00a0sweeping views over all of Athens and the Aegean Sea from the top of the Acropolis. The area is also home to the Olympieion, the Temple of Olympian Zeus; the Arch of Hadrian, built to honor the arrival of Roman Emperor Hadrian in 131 BC; and the Panathenaic Stadium (also known as Kallimarmaro Stadium), where\u00a0the first modern Olympic Games were held in 1896. Even if you make a wrong turn in Athens, you\u2019re guaranteed to stumble upon some sort of beautiful ruin sitting in the middle of a square or street.\n\nImage courtesy of Washed Over via Flickr.\n3. There\u2019s Plenty to Eat and Drink, Organically Speaking\n\nAt the height of the recession in 2008, chefs Dimitris Christoforidis and Christos Athanasiadis opened the first of three outposts named Nice n Easy, after\u00a0the Frank Sinatra song. At the time, the concept was a crazy one \u2014 not only were they starting a business, they were starting a trend, crafting a menu of organic dishes that paved the way for the organic wave\u00a0in Athens.\u00a0Their vegan-friendly and gluten-free dishes are chock-full of superfoods and named after stars like Audrey Hepburn and Bruce Lee. Some items add a modern spin to Greek favorites, using homemade halva as a dessert crumble over Greek yogurt ice cream and water buffalo yogurt and kefir dressing as a drizzle over salads \u2014 the water buffalo are an important part of the concept, grown on the restaurant\u2019s farm on Lake Kerkini.\u00a0The Marvin Gaye, made of water buffalo meatballs and white-beans, the special of the day\u00a0when I visited the restaurant, is pictured below.\n\nImage courtesy of the author.\nAlso in the neighborhood, celebrity chef Argiro Barbarigou at Papadakis is known for adding a modern touch to Greek cuisine, weaving in healthy elements\u00a0like multigrain blends and quinoa over salad. Hailing from the island of Paros, Argiro likes to share traditional recipes from home that are simple but filled with flavor thanks to her hand-selected ingredients. Case in point: the cherry tomato salad topped with caper leaves and traditional Xynomyzithra, a sour Greek whey cheese that\u2019s a favorite on the menu and just needs a drizzle of olive oil before it\u2019s good to go.\n\nYou can go the organic route with Greek wine, but why not spice things up a bit with gin? One of the city\u2019s top craft cocktail bars, the award-winning\u00a0Gin Joint, is set in the center off Karitsi Square \u2014 pretty much any type of gin cocktail you can imagine is on the list or can easily be crafted on the spot, but the other libations are just as good. While my friend sampled a series of gin cocktails, I went for the tequila-fueled Buena Libra mixed with lime, rose-petal preserve, chili and cardamom for a cocktail with a kick that still looks quite pretty.\n\n4.\u00a0These Wondrous Rooms With Views Can Be Yours\n\nIf you\u2019ve been waiting to cash in those Starpoints, now\u2019s the time. Five-star Hotel Grande Bretagne, A Luxury Collection Hotel, sits right on Syntagma Square with views of Parliament, Olympic Stadium and the Acropolis both from the rooms and the Roof Garden restaurant. Rates at the SPG Category 6 property start at 230 euros (about $239) or 25,000 Starpoints per night.\n\nA five-minute walk away in Plaka, the 79-room NEW Hotel is a member of Design Hotels, offering a Brazilian-influenced look by Brazilian designer brothers Fernando and Humberto Campana. Art lines the walls and sprouts from the floor, with columns mimicking trees in the dining room and chairs with backs that extend upward as ladders. Staying in one of the studios here, I found that the design was just one of the draws: I also loved waking up to a view of the Acropolis from my side balcony, as well as the Greek bath products by O.live, crafted with organic olive oil, lime, mandarin and basil. Rates at the SPG Category 5 hotel start at 131 euros (about $136) or 16,000 Starpoints per night.\n\nImage courtesy of the author.\n5. You Can Go Gaga Over Gucci and Greek Fashion\n\nNot far from Syntagma Square, you\u2019ll come across the neighborhood of Kolonaki, the swankier part of town where you\u2019ll find\u00a0all the major designer boutiques, from Giorgio Armani to Gucci. But don\u2019t think the city\u2019s only home to international designers. The Greek brand Zeus+Dione offers a collection of handwoven designs crafted in Crete and by craftswomen in the Cyclades islands, with items\u00a0sold in many of the local shops, as well as in its Kolonaki showroom. Barneys New York was the first store to stock Greek designer Ileana Makri\u2019s collection of evil eyes and Fatima hands back in 1999, but now boutiques and luxe department shops around the globe feature Makri\u2019s pieces. I happened to run into the designer at her namesake concept store in Kolonaki, a\u00a0bazaar of carefully curated designer jewelry and fashion, as well as a showroom for gorgeous, gem-encrusted\u00a0pieces that sit beautifully in glass cases.\n\nWhat are your favorite things to do in Athens?\u00a0Let us know in the comments, below.\n\nFeatured image courtesy of Konstantinos Dafalias via Flickr.\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card\n\nAPPLY NOW\n\nEarn 50,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.
