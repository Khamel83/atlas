      "Title": "Babies would rather talk to other babies than listen to your baby talk Quartz",
      "Selection": "We know that babies prefer the high-pitched sounds produced by their caregivers in \u201cbaby talk\u201d over regular speech, but a new study provides an exciting new perspective. At five months of age, it seems that babies prefer to listen to the sounds of their peers to the cooing of their mother. \n\nResearchers at the University of Quebec tested babies on their preference for different speakers by using a specialized speech synthesizer. They were able to simulate the effects of the human vocal tract\u2014the vocal cords, tongue and mouth\u2014to create vowels with differing pitch and resonance, representing vowels produced by vocal tracts of different sizes. \n\nThe apparatus let the researchers compare babies\u2019 responses to vowels produced by infants their own age, as well as vowels typical of an adult female\u2019s speech. They tested the babies\u2019 responses to different vowel sounds by training them to look towards or away from a chequerboard image. Simply by turning their heads, the babies indicated which sounds they preferred. \n\nThe results were striking. Five-month-olds listened to the infant vowels for 40% longer than the adult vowels, showing a clear preference for vowels that closely matched the sounds they produce themselves. \n\nThese findings present a new view on how we think about babies\u2019 early language learning. A lot of existing research focuses on the effect of parents\u2019 speech on language development; for example, how words produced in a higher pitch grab babies\u2019 attention more easily and go on to shape their early vocabulary. And there is no denying that baby talk is important in child development. Babies who hear more high-pitched baby talk from their caregivers have larger vocabularies at two years of age and higher IQs at age seven. \n\nBabble teaches babies to talk\n\nBut while babies prefer to listen to adult speech when it is produced at a higher pitch, a preference for infant vocalizations over and above this might have important implications for very early language learning. Authors of the study propose that it might motivate them to vocalize more in the first months of life, which could promote the transition to babble production just a few months later. \n\nBabble is the emergence of repeated language-like syllables consisting of one or two \u201cfavorite\u201d consonants, such as \u201cbababa.\u201d And we now know that it is an important indication of later language ability. Earlier onset of stable babbling leads to earlier word production and a larger vocabulary in the first two years of life. With this in mind, babies\u2019 implicit preference for their own vocalizations could be an important factor in their path to full language use.\n\nThis is not the first study to suggest that infants\u2019 own vocalizations may play an important role in language learning. Perception of consonants produced in their own babble may help infants filter the speech stream into something more manageable. \n\nStudies have shown that infants prefer to listen to words that match the sounds produced in their babble. For example, an infant who produces many \u201cbababa\u201d sounds will prefer made-up words containing \u201cb,\u201d such as \u201cbapeb,\u201d \u201cpabep\u201d and \u201cpobep\u201d. This is similar to the \u201ccocktail-party effect,\u201d where even in a noisy room we can pick out words that are more relevant to us, such as our name or the town where we live. \n\nIn the same way, infants\u2019 attention is drawn to words that match the sounds they produce most often, helping them pick out words from the speech stream that they\u2019re more likely to be able to produce. It\u2019s no coincidence that infants\u2019 very first words have babble-like qualities: \u201cmummy,\u201d \u201cdaddy,\u201d \u201cbaby\u201d and onomatopoeic words such as \u201cbaa baa\u201d and \u201cwoof woof.\u201d\n\nThe importance of infants\u2019 perception of their own vocalizations is supported by research into babies who are deaf. Studies of deaf babies have shown that they do babble but they start babbling much later than hearing infants. \n\nWithout feedback on their own babble production, deaf infants typically cease to babble after a few months. These studies have allowed us to piece together a more comprehensive picture of how human language emerges, taking into account the importance of infant vocalization long before they produce their first word. \n\nBabies learn from the adult world around them, but they also learn from their own early vocalizations. These new findings suggest that this begins much earlier than we previously thought. Perhaps language production does not start with words or even babble, but with vocalizations that begin long before the first speech-like sounds are produced.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.
