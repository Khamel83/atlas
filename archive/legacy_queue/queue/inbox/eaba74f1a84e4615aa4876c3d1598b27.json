You probably don\u2019t know whether you\u2019ll stick with your new endeavor long enough to make an expensive purchase worth it. And when you\u2019re a beginner, it\u2019s not like beginner level equipment is going to hold you back\u2026\n\nHow cheap is too cheap?\n\nFind out what is totally useless, and never worth your time. Garage sale ice skates with ankles that are so soft they flop over? Pass them up.\n\nWhat do most people do when starting out?\n\nIf you\u2019re getting into powerlifting and you don\u2019t have a belt and shoes, you can still lift with no belt and no shoes, or with the old pair of Chucks that you may already have in your closet. Ask people about what they wore when they were starting out, and it\u2019s often one of those options\u2026\n\nWhat\u2019s your exit plan?\n\nHow will you decide when you\u2019re done with your beginner equipment? Some things will wear out: Running shoes will feel flat and deflated. Some things may still be usable, but you\u2019ll discover their limitations. Ask experienced people what the fancier gear can do that yours can\u2019t, and you\u2019ll get a sense of when to upgrade. (You may also be able to sell still-good gear to another beginner to recoup some of your costs.)\n\nWearing out your beginner gear is like graduating. You know that you\u2019ve stuck with the sport long enough that you aren\u2019t truly a beginner anymore. You may have managed to save up some cash for the next step. And you can buy the nicer gear now, knowing exactly what you want and need.\n\nThis is 100 percent the truth, and applies to way more than just sports equipment. Computers, cooking, fashion, cars, furniture, you name it. The key thing is to pick your spots, figure out where you actually know what you want and what you want to do with it, and optimize for those. Everywhere else? Don\u2019t outwit yourself. Play it like the beginner that you are. And save some scratch in the process. Perfect, perfect advice.\n\nTags: computing\u00a0\u00a0 cooking\u00a0\u00a0 Lifehacker\u00a0\u00a0 sports",
