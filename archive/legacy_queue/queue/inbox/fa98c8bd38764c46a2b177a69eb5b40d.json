      "Selection": "The bowline is one of the most useful knots you can know. Simple to tie, and easy to undo, the beauty of the bowline is that it creates a quick loop secured by a knot that tightens when under load. Sailors use the bowline to fasten halyards and other rigging which require a super-secure connection. \u00a0\n\nThe one-handed bowline is a technique that allows you to tie the knot using only one hand. Why is that useful? Imagine you\u2019ve slipped and fallen into a rushing river. At the last second, you grab the branch of a tree, but you can\u2019t pull yourself up. A friend tosses you a rope to tie around yourself, but the only knots you can tie would require the use of both hands. With a one-handed bowline, you can secure a loop around your body while still holding onto the branch. In most scenarios this is a survival knot tied around your waist, but it can be adapted to a number of circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLike this illustrated guide? Then you\u2019re going to love our book\u00a0The Illustrated Art of Manliness! Pick up a copy on\u00a0Amazon.\n\nIllustrated by Ted Slampyak\n\nThe post How to Tie a One-Handed Bowline Knot appeared first on The Art of Manliness.\n",
