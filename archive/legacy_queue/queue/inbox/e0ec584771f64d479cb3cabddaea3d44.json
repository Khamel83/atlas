      "Title": "Why You Should Skip Bali for This Indonesian Paradise The Points Guy",
      "Selection": "Bali, Indonesia, is all the rage, with more than three million visitors flocking to the gorgeous island each year.\u00a0But that\u2019s precisely the problem. Thanks to books like Eat, Pray, Love,\u00a0a growth in fancy yoga retreats and luxe resorts and a new, relaxed visa policy, Bali isn\u2019t the sleepy Indonesian beach-bum town it used to be. Hordes of tourists and expensive hotels and restaurants have since sullied the island\u2019s charm.\n\nSo forget Bali, but don\u2019t give up your dream of a Indonesian dream vacation. If you\u2019re looking for an off-the-beaten-path adventure that\u2019s cheaper and more authentic yet still includes amazing diving, snorkeling and deserted sandy beaches, the Gili Islands are where it\u2019s at.\n\nComprised of\u00a0three small Indonesian islands located off the northwest coast of Lombok, the Gili Islands are\u00a0Gili Meno,\u00a0Gili Air and Gili Trawangan. Gili Meno is the tranquil island, perfect for a restful vacation full of peaceful sunsets and fruit smoothies, or for honeymooners looking for lots of romantic, deserted beaches. Gili Air has the largest local population and is a fun mix of calm shores and happening beach bars \u2014 having both\u00a0more infrastructure and\u00a0a calm environment makes this island nice for families and couples. Gili Trawangan is great for groups of friends or solo travelers wanting to party it up, with beach clubs pumping music until the wee hours of the morning.\n\nUpon stepping onto the white sandy shores of the Gili Islands, I knew I was in for a special experience. You\u2019ll feel the same way, I\u2019m sure. Here\u2019s why you should head there.\n\nThe crystal-clear waters of Gili Meno.

Image courtesy of the author.\nThe no-car rule makes the islands feel quaint and tranquil, allowing travelers to truly escape. As the islands are fairly small, you can move around on foot\u00a0\u2014 bike rentals are widely available, too. (Prepare to jump off your bike and walk when the pathways get too sandy, though.) For those worried about carrying heavy luggage, there are horse carts available, ready to take you from the docks to the various hotels and bungalows around the island.\n\nBike rentals\u00a0should cost you between $3 and $6 per day per bike. Image courtesy of the author.\nAll Three Islands Are Super-Affordable\n\nWhereas Bali is slowly becoming a leader in luxury travel, the Gili Islands remain inexpensive \u2014 an air-conditioned inland bungalow with a private bathroom and Wi-Fi, for instance, can cost you as little as $20 per night. More luxurious hotels are also widely available, but still at a fairly reasonable price, and backpackers can easily find plenty of cheap shared dorm options. Beachfront dining can cost as little as a few dollars per meal if you stick to the local cuisine, like nasi goreng\u00a0(fried rice, typically served with chicken). Western food, finer dining and fresh seafood are all available and affordable \u2014 even a splurge on a feast won\u2019t break your budget on these islands. Activities are also pretty cheap, and an afternoon of scuba diving \u2014 including all equipment, monitors and boat rides \u2014 generally run about $45. Whether you want to travel like a backpacker, a king or anyone in between, the Gilis have got you covered.\n\nYou Can Truly Go off the Grid\n\nMany locals still reside on the Gilis and the interior of the islands are quite rural, so don\u2019t be surprised to see roaming chickens and goats, wooden bungalow homestays and makeshift restaurants dotting the sandy roads. You may hear strains of Arabic now and then because Indonesia is an Islamic country where the locals pray several times a day. The people living here are friendly, open to tourists and enjoy sharing their tranquil way of life with visitors. Though Wi-Fi is widely available, you may find yourself letting go of life\u2019s modern comforts and just enjoying the simple way of life the Gilis are known for. There are unique surprises around the islands to discover for yourself, like a small inland saltwater lake on Gili Meno, one of the best spots in the world to enjoy a sunset.\n\nA breathtaking sunset over the inland lake on Gili Meno.

Of course, if you prefer beaches with all the amenities, there are plenty of spots with beachfront dining, lounge chairs, beanbags, kayaks and paddle-board rentals, among other activities.\n\nWhite sands, clear waters and virtually no one on the beach! Image courtesy of the author.\nCruising the island by bike can help you find the perfect beach, as there are many small beach bars with hammocks strung up and reggae on the radio just waiting for you to stop and enjoy a fresh fruit smoothie or cold beer.\n\nMost beach bars will also rent you snorkel gear \u2014 the Gili Islands may be one of the few places you can see giant hawksbill turtles so close to the shore. Snorkel day trips are also available from boats that take you to various spots around the islands. (It\u2019s the perfect place to get your PADI certification, too.) Check out Blue Marlin Dive, which has locations on all three islands. Hopefully you\u2019ll spot a reef shark or a giant sunfish, as both species can be found in the Gili waters.\n\nA sea turtle shows off for divers in the Gili Islands.

The public ferry boat takes about five hours and is the cheapest option, but you can also fly between Bali and Lombok on Lion Air and Wings Air, then take the ferry.\n\nTo get to the Gili Islands via Lombok, hop a flight on AirAsia from Kuala Lumpur, a SilkAir flight from Singapore or a\u00a0Garuda Indonesia (a SkyTeam alliance member) flight from Jakarta. Once in Lombok, you have several options for public ferries and private speedboats at a variety of prices. The trip takes about 15 minutes from Lombok, so if you prefer a shorter boat ride, this is the ideal option. Plus, Lombok is a lovely island to explore, with plenty of beaches, great surfing and the famous Mount Rinjani volcano. It also tends to have fewer tourists than Bali.\n\nA charted speedboat from Lombok to the Gili Islands cost me about $35 one way for a 15-minute ride. Image courtesy of the author.\nThere are also\u00a0plenty of options to use points and miles to get to an\u00a0Asian hub like Kuala Lumpur, Singapore or Jakarta. Although Garuda Indonesia doesn\u2019t yet operate flights to the US, the carrier does fly to Asia from Europe, and is a ThankYou Rewards transfer member, as are Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific and EVA Air.\n\nHave you been to the Gili Islands?
