      "Selection": "Yesterday (Sept. 27), US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the professor of clinical psychology who accuses him of sexual assault, delivered\u00a0nearly nine hours of emotional testimony. There were tears; there was rage; there were explanations of neuroscience and eulogies to beer.\n\nThroughout it all, America was watching.\u00a0According to Nielsen ratings, nearly 20% of US households with televisions were watching the hearings at any given time between 10am and 6:45pm. That\u2019s without factoring in the many more who watched it in public places, on their phones, via digital livestreams, or who caught up on the highlights online after work.\n\nFor CNN, it was the channel\u2019s biggest live video day since the Trump inauguration. For\u00a0CBS News, it was its most-viewed livestream of the year. And at Fox, where opinion hosts have openly championed Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, viewers averaged 7.2 million during his appearance and 4.7 million during Ford\u2019s.\n\nYesterday\u2019s hearings meant many different things to many different people\u2014a referendum on #MeToo, a masterclass in the evils of \u201cbro culture\u201d (paywall),\u00a0a worrying outcome for American men and boys. But one thing remained consistent across party lines: The Kavanaugh hearings were very, very important\u2014even if the \u201cwhy\u201d has proven more contentious.\n",
