      "Selection": "In his excellent market history book,\u00a0It Was a Very Good Year,\u00a0Martin Fridson tells the story of the year that was in the market in 1915.\n\nIt remains one of the strongest years on record for the stock market, which was up more than 50%, even though World War I was well underway at the time.\n\nFridson discusses how differently stocks were viewed in the early 20th century than they are now:\n\nJournalists commonly equated the established dividend payout with the return on the stock, giving little thought to possible appreciation. They compared the payout rate directly with bond yields; total return\u2019s day hadn\u2019t yet arrived. The prevailing orthodoxy held that dividend yields had to exceed prevailing interest rates on bonds to compensate for the greater uncertainty of payment. Not until several decades after the Big Board stopped quoting stocks like bonds would this mindset change.\n\nThe big changeover came in the 1950s when the dividend yield on the stock market finally dipped under the yield on government bonds. Until the 1950s, when bonds yielded more than stocks it was a clear signal that it was time to get out of the stock market.\n\nThat relationship broke down and I think one of the reasons it happened is because investors became more comfortable with the capital appreciation side of the return equation. The stock market was maturing as were investors.\n\nIn the latest JP Morgan Guide to the Markets they compared dividend to capital appreciation by decade going back to the 1950s:\n\nYou can see dividends were still a healthy 3-5% from the 1950s through the 1980s. Now you can see a slow progression down in the importance of dividend yields since the 1990s.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons for this shift is the increase is stock buybacks. In the early 1980s, the SEC instituted a new regulation that gave corporations incentives to repurchase their own shares. You can clearly see how this trend has changed stock yields over time:\n\nDividend yields were already beginning to fall but buybacks have accelerated the process as corporations have used them as another way to return money to shareholders.\n\nAswath Damodaran broke these yields down by year on his blog recently:\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the buyback yield to supplant the dividend yield on the S&P 500. In fact, the buyback yield has now been higher than the dividend yield for the past 9 years in a row.1\n\nAnother way of thinking about the shrinking importance of dividends is by looking at the yields on both the S&P 500 and more tech-heavy Nasdaq over time:\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 has barely sniffed 1% in dividends but has still managed to outperform the S&P handily:\n\nYou could claim recency bias here but the Nasdaq has actually beaten the S&P over the long haul as well.\n\nFrom its inception in 1973, the Nasdaq Composite Index has returned roughly 11% per year. In that same time, the S&P 500 has returned around 10.4% annually.\n\nBeyond buybacks, one of the biggest reasons for the lower dividend yield on the S&P 500 is the change in sector composition over time.\n\nHere are the current sector weights of the S&P 500 along with the corresponding dividend yields:\n\nThe average dividend yield for the top 5 sectors by weighting (which make up over 75% of the index) is 1.6%. The average dividend yield for the bottom 6 sectors (which make up less than 25% of the index) is 2.5%.\n\nThis is mostly a U.S. phenomenon. International stocks still have higher dividend rates:\n\nThis is partly buybacks, partly sectors, and partly the stronger performance in the U.S.\n\nI\u2019m not saying dividend\u00a0strategies\u00a0don\u2019t matter anymore; just that dividends don\u2019t play as big of a role in market cap weighted U.S. indexes as much as they used to.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible dividend-based strategies or even those sectors with higher dividends could do better from here, especially given the strong run in tech stocks over the past decade or so.\n\nBut it is fascinating to see witness the structural changes in the way dividends are viewed over time.\n\nIn the past, dividends were the only reason investors placed their money in equities. Now, dividends play a much smaller role, for better or worse, in the overall stock market.\n\nFurther Reading:\nThe Half-Life of Investment Strategies\n\n1Cue the conspiracy crowd who will complain the market has been manipulated by buybacks.\n\n\u00a0\n",
