The scheduled in-person campaign event was canceled due to Covid-19. | Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThe coronavirus shows tying health insurance to jobs is a disaster. Let\u2019s fix it.\u00a0\n\nAccording to a new analysis by the consulting firm Health Management Associates (HMA), the Covid-19 crisis could lead to between 12 million and 35 million people losing employer-sponsored health coverage due to job losses.\n\nNot all of them will tumble into the ranks of the uninsured. Some will be caught by Medicaid, by Obamacare, or by other safety net programs. Some will find new jobs, with new insurance. But millions will fall through the cracks, particularly in states that have refused to expand Medicaid. In a scenario where unemployment hits 25 percent \u2014 calamitous, but plausible \u2014 HMA forecasts that as many as 11 million people could find themselves uninsured. That wipes out about half of Obamacare\u2019s coverage gains, practically overnight.\n\n Health Management Associates\n\nHere, as elsewhere, Covid-19 is worsening a policy problem that long predates the virus. Tying health insurance to employment is now, and always has been, a disaster. It gives bosses too much power over workers, reduces entrepreneurship, saddles businesses with health costs they can\u2019t control and insurance problems they don\u2019t understand, makes the tax structure more regressive, reduces wages, bloats administrative spending, and drives up costs throughout the system.\n\nIt has also, as Paul Starr writes in Remedy and Reaction: The Peculiar American Struggle Over Health Care Reform, created a \u201cpolicy trap\u201d that has stymied health reformers over and over again: About 160 million Americans get insurance through their employers, and for all the system\u2019s flaws, they are mostly pretty happy with that insurance, which makes them resistant to disruptive change.\n\nBut disruptive change is here, whether anyone wants it or not. It won\u2019t just be felt in the rising ranks of the uninsured, in the millions of people who lose the insurance provided by their workplace and have to scramble, desperately, for an alternative. It will also be felt by those who keep their job-based insurance, only to see it degrade as their employer rushes to cut costs.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, average premiums for employer-based insurance have risen 54 percent over the past decade \u2014 far outpacing wages or inflation. Cost-sharing has increased, too: Average annual deductibles have doubled in the past decade. Employers have been shunting health costs onto employees in both good times and bad, and these are the worst times. Many of those who keep their employer-based insurance will see their premiums and deductibles rise, their networks narrow.\n\n Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nThis is a crisis. But it is also, perhaps, an opportunity to solve the policy trap and finally move beyond employer-based insurance.\n\nThe two poles of the Democratic health care debate\n\nThe Democratic primary was defined by the debate over Bernie Sanders\u2019s Medicare-for-all plan, which, in its expansive and uncompromising ambition, rolled a number of health reform debates into one. But one of its best features, substantively, was that it ended employer-based insurance forever.\n\nThe problem is that canceling 160 million insurance plans is likely to be a political catastrophe. When polled, it routinely turned people against Medicare-for-all. Most members of Congress \u2014 including some co-sponsors of Sanders\u2019s bill \u2014 blanched at that level of disruption. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed it, as did the Senate Democrats who will lead the next health care push. The logic was straightforward: If the problem you\u2019re trying to solve is that people hate losing the insurance their employer gives them, forcibly taking it away from them isn\u2019t likely to go over well.\n\nMoreover, the tax increases necessary to move the entirety of the employer-based system onto the federal budget would be eye-popping. That\u2019s what killed the statewide single-payer push in Sanders\u2019s home state of Vermont, and Sanders never said how he\u2019d solve it nationally.\n\nBut if the political weakness of Sanders\u2019s plan is that it upends too much of the current system, the substantive weakness of Biden\u2019s plan is that it does too little to transform the current system.\n\nBiden\u2019s plan leaves the current system more or less intact, but adds a subsidized, Medicare-based public option available to individuals and small businesses. Under the Biden proposal, the employer-based system remains, but if you lose your job, or simply don\u2019t like or can\u2019t afford the insurance offered by your employer, you have another option. The plan would also serve low-income Americans in states that refused to expand Medicaid, giving them an option they desperately need.\n\nBut the Biden team made a series of policy choices to limit the impact their public plan would have on employer-based health insurance. Large employers are not allowed to buy into the new public option. Individuals can\u2019t use the money their employer is spending on private health insurance to buy into the public option. What they\u2019ve built isn\u2019t a glide path to Medicare-for-all, or even to a new hybrid system. Instead, they\u2019ve created a backstop to reinforce the current system, with all its flaws. And over the next year, the coronavirus is going to make those flaws gruesomely apparent.\n\n BernieSanders.com via Getty Images\n\nSen.

Kim/Chicago Tribune via Getty Images\n\nJoe Biden campaigns in Flint, Michigan, on March 9.\n\nThe Biden team\u2019s fear is that opening the public option to all employers would destabilize the employer-based system \u2014 companies with sicker, older workforces would rush into the public system, driving up its costs, or perhaps they would nudge their older, sicker employees to enter into it so they could offload their spending onto taxpayers. These concerns are reasonable, but they\u2019re also manageable. Whether you choose to solve them reflects whether you think the American health care system is fundamentally broken or just needs to be patched up.\n\nBiden\u2019s plan would require far less in new taxes than Sanders\u2019s plan \u2014 the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated the 10-year cost of Biden\u2019s proposal at $2.25 trillion while Sanders\u2019s bill clocked in at $30.6 trillion \u2014 but even pre-coronavirus, CRFB estimated that it would still leave 10 million to 15 million people uninsured. Post-coronavirus, it will leave millions more uninsured, and it will have little to offer those who keep their employer-based plan but find themselves paying more and more for less and less.\n\nWith Sanders\u2019s exit from the race, Biden is a lock to win the Democratic nomination. But his win will leave many progressives disappointed. Biden needs a way to reach out to them. A good place to start would be a better health care plan \u2014 one that\u2019s truly universal and that ends employer control over health insurance.\n\nI think the disunity might be driven by real cleavages such as the fact that millions of people are currently getting kicked off their private health insurance in the middle of a public health crisis and Joe Biden stubbornly opposes a policy to untether insurance from employment\n\n\u2014 Meagan Day (@meaganmday) April 8, 2020\n\nBiden isn\u2019t going to embrace Sanders\u2019s Medicare-for-all plan. But he can do better than his current health care proposal, and he should. I can even suggest a place for him to start.\n\nMedicare Extra is the middle ground Democrats need\n\nBack in July, the Center for American Progress released its \u201cMedicare Extra\u201d proposal. As I wrote at the time, the plan was, and is, an intriguing synthesis of left and moderate ideas on health reform. It\u2019s universal, it uses Medicare\u2019s pricing power to hold down costs, it rebuilds the health system around public insurance \u2014 and it gives everyone, everywhere, a true choice between public and private options, no matter what their employer is offering. In all those ways, it goes much further than Bidencare.\n\nAt the same time, Medicare Extra retains private insurance options, allows employers to continue offering insurance to employees if they think they can provide something better than the public option, and it holds the total price tag to somewhere in the $2.8 trillion to $4.5 trillion range. Which is to say, it\u2019s not nearly as disruptive as Sanders\u2019s Medicare-for-all bill, and it only requires about a tenth of the tax increases.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n\nMedicare Extra builds a new public insurance program called, well, Medicare Extra. The new plan shares Medicare\u2019s name, but its benefits are much more expansive: It includes, for instance, vision, dental, and reproductive health coverage.\n\nEveryone in the system, from individuals getting insurance from their employer to traditional Medicare enrollees, could choose to purchase Medicare Extra instead, and they\u2019d be eligible for normal subsidies and employer cash-outs if they did so. So unlike in Biden\u2019s plan, employers could buy Medicare Extra for their employees, and even if they didn\u2019t, employees could take the money their employer is spending on private insurance and use it to buy Medicare Extra.\n\nPremiums are on a sliding scale, with Americans under 150 percent of the poverty line paying nothing and those making 500 percent of the poverty line or more seeing their total contribution capped at 9 percent of income. Cost-sharing, too, varies by income, with total out-of-pocket spending, even for the richest, capped at $5,000.\n\nNewborns would automatically be enrolled in Medicare Extra, as would the uninsured and every legal resident upon turning 65. Medicaid and Obamacare would be folded into the new program, and anyone on traditional Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Tricare, Veterans Affairs coverage, the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, the Indian Health Service, or employer-sponsored coverage could opt in.\n\nThe plan saves money by expanding Medicare\u2019s pricing power throughout the system \u2014 including to employer-provided private insurance. It\u2019s the first of the major Democratic proposals to rely on a version of all-payer rate setting.\n\nThere are plenty of details and decisions in this plan worth debating. But something like Medicare Extra offers a middle ground that this moment demands. It eases the disruption of reform without reinforcing the dysfunctions of the status quo; it makes employer-provided health insurance one option people can freely choose, if they prefer it, rather than making it the only option most people have; and it creates a system that, while not single-payer, is far more integrated than anything we have now: a public system with private options, rather than a private system with fractured public options.\n\nSo far, Biden has done a good job releasing plans and making statements about how he would manage the coronavirus crisis. What he hasn\u2019t done is reveal a vision for rebuilding in its aftermath. He\u2019s offering a candidacy to feel relieved about, rather than inspired by. But coronavirus, and the damage it will unleash on an already broken health care system, demands more than that.\n\nFinding a synthesis in the health reform debate, one that respects the moderate\u2019s fear of disruption, the leftist critique of the status quo, and the post-coronavirus reality that now surrounds us, would be a good place to start.\n\nSupport Vox\u2019s explanatory journalism\n\nEvery day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.
