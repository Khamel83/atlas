      "Selection": "Here\u2019s the link to apply now for the IHG Rewards Club Premier Credit Card with a 125,000-point bonus after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first three months.\n\nIf you\u2019re the type of traveler who prefers to get the most nights out of your hotel points, this article \u2014 and the entire \u201cStretch Your Points\u201d miniseries \u2014 is for you. In recent installments of this series, I\u2019ve presented some low-tier Marriott properties, domestic Hyatt properties, international Hyatt properties, domestic Hilton properties, international Hilton properties and domestic IHG properties where you can stretch your points.\n\nIt\u2019s not a secret that my husband, JT, and I have stayed at a lot of IHG properties since giving up our apartment over two years ago. In fact, we\u2019ve actually stayed at many of the properties described below. So, even more so than the previous installments of this series, the list below isn\u2019t simply a theoretical discussion of IHG\u2019s best international properties that you can book for 10,000 points per night. Instead, it\u2019s a compilation of hotels that we\u2019re likely to visit (or revisit) due to their location and how far our points can take us there.\n\nLet\u2019s continue this miniseries by studying how many nights you can squeeze out of the current 125,000-point sign-up bonus on the IHG Rewards Club Premier Credit Card, as well as look at some international IHG properties where you can stay for just 10,000 points per night.\n\nIn This Post\n\nHow many nights can I get from the bonus?\n\nThe IHG Rewards Club Premier Credit Card currently offers an increased sign-up bonus of 125,000 points after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first three months. The card provides an anniversary free night that\u2019s valid at properties costing 40,000 points or less, which makes it relatively easy for most cardholders to justify the $89 annual fee. But the card\u2019s other perks, including IHG Platinum Elite status, can also provide significant value. Plus, cardholders get a fourth night free on award stays, which means you can stretch your points even further when you stay for four nights or longer.\n\nRelated: IHG Rewards Club Premier Card credit card review\n\nIHG award nights normally start at 10,000 points per night. So not counting the points earned while meeting the spending requirements to trigger the welcome bonus, you could squeeze 16 nights out of the IHG Premier Card\u2019s 125,000-point bonus if you stay in increments of four nights at 10,000-point properties (aka four nights for 30k points). TPG\u2019s most recent valuation pegs the value of IHG points at 0.5 cents each, so 10,000 points are worth about $50 and the 30,000 points needed for a four-night stay at a 10,000-point property are worth about $150.\n\nAlternatively, you could book select properties from the PointBreaks list for as little as 5,000 points per night. This means you could theoretically squeeze 33 nights out of the IHG Premier Card\u2019s 125,000-point bonus. But, since the properties on the PointBreaks list change every few months and are removed from the list once the PointBreaks allotment for that property is exhausted, this guide only considers properties that normally cost 10,000 points per night.\n\nProperty profiles\n\nIHG currently has 366 10,000-point properties globally and 248 of these properties, or 68%, are outside the U.S. Here\u2019s the breakdown based on brand of the 10,000-point IHG properties located outside the U.
