From Hyperallergic:\n\nParis Mus\u00e9es is a public entity that oversees the 14 municipal museums of Paris, including the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Petit Palais, and the Catacombs. Users can download a file that contains a high definition (300 DPI) image, a document with details about the selected work, and a guide of best practices for using and citing the sources of the image.\n\n\u201cMaking this data available guarantees that our digital files can be freely accessed and reused by anyone or everyone, without any technical, legal or financial restraints, whether for commercial use or not,\u201d reads a press release shared by Paris Mus\u00e9es.\n\nWhat a treasure trove this is. I was particularly happy to see a bunch of work in here from Eug\u00e8ne Atget, chronicler of Parisian streets, architecture, and residents and one of my favorite photographers.\n\n(via @john_overholt)\n\nTags: art\u00a0\u00a0 museums\u00a0\u00a0 Paris\u00a0\u00a0 photography",
