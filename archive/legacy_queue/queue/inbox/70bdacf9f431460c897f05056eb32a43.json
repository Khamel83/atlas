      "Selection": "A top-tier Android phone can cost upwards of a thousand dollars, and for that money, you\u2019ll get some amazing features. It will have a stellar screen, top-flight camera, gobs of storage, and an absolutely atrocious texting experience.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem. In fact, it\u2019s always been a problem. Google has spent nearly a decade trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to fix it with an ever-rotating cast of poorly supported apps. While iPhone users have had the simplicity of iMessage built in, Android users have been left to fend for themselves. \n\nNow, the company is doing something different. Instead of bringing a better app to the table, it\u2019s trying to change the rules of the texting game, on a global scale. Google has been quietly corralling every major cellphone carrier on the planet into adopting technology to replace SMS. It\u2019s going to be called \u201cChat,\u201d and it\u2019s based on a standard called the \u201cUniversal Profile for Rich Communication Services.\u201d SMS is the default that everybody has to fall back to, and so Google\u2019s goal is to make that default texting experience on an Android phone as good as other modern messaging apps.\n\nAs part of that effort, Google says it\u2019s \u201cpausing\u201d work on its most recent entry into the messaging space, Allo. It\u2019s the sort of \u201cpause\u201d that involves transferring almost the entire team off the project and putting all its resources into another app, Android Messages.\n\nGoogle won\u2019t build the iMessage clone that Android fans have clamored for, but it seems to have cajoled the carriers into doing it for them. In order to have some kind of victory in messaging, Google first had to admit defeat.\n\n        Illustration by William Joel & Garret Beard\n\nWhat Chat will be\n\nChat is not a new texting app. Instead, think of it more like a new set of features inside the app already installed on most Android phones. \u201cChat\u201d is the consumer-friendly name for Rich Communication Services (RCS), the new standard that\u2019s meant to supplant SMS, and it will automatically be turned on inside Android Messages, the OS\u2019s default app for texting. \n\nWhen people begin using Chat, they\u2019ll get many features that are standard in any other texting app, including read receipts, typing indicators, full-resolution images and video, and group texts. \n\nBut remember, Chat is a carrier-based service, not a Google service. It\u2019s just \u201cChat,\u201d not \u201cGoogle Chat.\u201d In a sign of its strategic importance to Google, the company has spearheaded development on the new standard, so that every carrier\u2019s Chat services will be interoperable. But, like SMS, Chat won\u2019t be end-to-end encrypted, and it will follow the same legal intercept standards. In other words: it won\u2019t be as secure as iMessage or Signal.\n\nThe new Chat services will be turned on for most people in the near future, though timing will be dictated by each carrier. Google is optimistic many carriers will flip the switch this year, but there could be some stragglers. Chat messages will be sent with your data plan instead of your SMS plan, so you\u2019ll likely only be charged for whatever (minimal) data it costs to send a message. Though, again, it will be up to the carriers.\n\nIf you are texting somebody who doesn\u2019t have Chat enabled or is not an Android user, your messages will revert back to SMS \u2014 much in the same way that an iMessage does. Nobody outside of Apple knows when (or if) the iPhone will support Chat.\n\nInstead of continuing to push Allo \u2014 or creating yet another new chat app \u2014 Google is instead going to introduce new features into the default Android Messages app, like GIF search and Google Assistant. Android Messages will be the default on many (but not all) Android phones. Samsung phones will also support Chat using Samsung\u2019s app. You will still be able to download Google\u2019s app if you\u2019d prefer to use it, though it seems unlikely that third-party developers will be able to create full RCS-enabled apps.\n\n        Anil Sabharwal.\n\n        Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nReboot again\n\nGoogle has put a new executive in charge of the effort: Anil Sabharwal. He led the team that created the Google Photos apps, which are perhaps the most successful Google apps of the past few years. They\u2019re also a great example of how Google salvaged ideas originally built into Google+ and turned them into a great set of cross-platform apps.\n\nSo it makes perfect sense that CEO Sundar Pichai tasked Sabharwal with fixing one of the oldest and most vexing problems at Google. Sabharwal has to find a way to make the default texting experience on Android not just good, but part of a dominant global network that can actually compete with the likes of WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and iMessage. And he needs to do it without alienating any of the hundreds of powerful companies that have a stake in the smartphone market. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming into this as a consumer product person,\u201d Sabharwal says. Six months ago, he took over the communications team and took inventory of Google\u2019s offerings and strategies. As a result of Google\u2019s \u201ctry everything\u201d approach to messaging, the company currently has four major competing messaging apps: Hangouts, Allo, Duo, and Android Messages. \n\nLet\u2019s go through them one by one. Hangouts is becoming an enterprise app to compete with Slack, called \u201cHangouts Chat\u201d instead of being a consumer focused app. That transition is taking awhile and at some point, Google will need to clear up its messaging for consumers that are still using Hangouts for personal texting. Right now, the company\u2019s guidance is that \u201cthe consumer version of Hangouts will be upgraded to Hangouts Chat ... but our focus for Hangouts still rests on enterprise/team communication and messaging.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a free version was made available to consumers someday, but, as with Allo, if might be time to start looking for alternatives.\n\nAnd Duo, Google\u2019s new-ish video chat app, is actually surprisingly successful; a quarter of Duo calls are to or from an iPhone. But it\u2019s primarily a video chat app, which leaves Allo and Android Messages: two apps that, from a \u201cconsumer product\u201d perspective, do essentially the same thing. \n\nAndroid Messages has all the users. Even though Samsung phones don\u2019t use Android Messages as the default SMS app, most of the other major manufacturers do (outside of China, anyway). That adds up to 100 million monthly active users, according to Sabharwal. \u201cAt the end of the day \u2026 the native SMS app is where users are,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re not interested in going to a different place to use SMS.\u201d\n\nPeople, even in 2018, tend to just use the default app. Though WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger each have over a billion installs, those users are still falling back to SMS when they have to. It\u2019s the universal, default option; every phone supports it, and it always works. Sabharwal estimates that 8 trillion SMS-based messages are sent every year.\n\n\u201cThe native SMS app is where users are.\u201d  \n\n        Google Allo.\n\nAllo, though it\u2019s a perfectly capable and functional messaging app, has never managed to build a large user base. Sabharwal looked at Allo and saw \u201ca clearly great set of product features, a great set of capabilities.\u201d He looked at Android Messages and saw \u201ca product that has tremendous momentum.\u201d\n\nSo the move was obvious: shift all that effort from Allo, which doesn\u2019t have a clear path to getting more users, and put it into migrating the app\u2019s features into the default, Android Messages. \u201cMy first thing is I\u2019m going to bring these things together,\u201d Sabharwal says. \u201cThat\u2019s the first decision that we\u2019ve made.\u201d\n\nPut more bluntly: Google is giving up on having its own consumer messaging app, a heads-up competitor to Facebook Messenger. \u201cThere are a lot of great messaging products and experiences that are out there,\u201d says Sabharwal. \u201cJust because Google may want to be one of them is not a reason for us to invest or build products. We fundamentally build products because we believe we can deliver better, improved user experiences.\u201d\n\nTake a step back. It seems ridiculous that a company as large and powerful as Google would simply give up on directly competing in the messaging space, but here we are. The question, then, is how on earth did we get here?\n\nAllo the apps that didn\u2019t work \n\nA brief and very incomplete history of Android\u2019s Messaging Mess\n\nAugust 2005: Google Talk (aka Google Chat)\n\nOctober 2008: Android launches with support for Google Talk & SMS\n\nJune 2011: Google+ launches, distracting everybody. It includes Huddle and Hangouts Video Chat\n\nAugust 2011: Facebook Messenger launches as a standalone app\n\nOctober 2011: iMessage launches. WhatsApp reports 1 billion messages per day\n\nMay 2013: Google+ Hangouts launches, merging other Google messaging and video chat apps\n\nSeptember 2014: Google Voice integrated into Hangouts\n\nApril 2015: Project Fi launches, also integrating with Hangouts\n\nJanuary 2016: Google Messenger becomes the preferred SMS app on Android, deprecating Hangouts for texting.\n\nMay 2016: Google launches Allo, a texting app, and Duo, a video chat app\n\nJune 2016: Google Talk for Android and Google Chat in Gmail discontinued\n\nFebruary 2017: Messenger is renamed Android Messages, announced it will be the default RCS app\n\nMarch 2017: Google announces Hangouts is becoming Hangouts Chat, focused on enterprise use\n\nApril 2018: Google is \u201cpausing investment\u201d in Allo, focusing instead on Chat, a new standard to replace SMS\n\nGoogle\u2019s plan this time around is much more complicated than just launching a new messaging app. To get it started, it has had to corral more than 50 carriers and nearly a dozen manufacturers into adopting a new standard. It had to ensure that Chat would work the same, everywhere, and that it would actually have a decent set of features. Oh, and all those companies are fierce competitors who distrust each other and Google.\n\nIt is as close to the hardest, most winding road that I can imagine for fixing the messaging mess on Android. It\u2019s also probably one of the only roads Google had left to try. \n\nGoogle\u2019s most prominent messaging dead end was Hangouts. Launched almost exactly five years ago, it was Google\u2019s most ambitious attempt to compete with iMessage, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger. It had a huge, splashy launch befitting its scope, and it successfully managed to merge a bunch of disparate Google apps into a single, unified system.\n\nHangouts was undone by Google\u2019s often scattered corporate priorities and, frankly, sometimes institutional inability to execute on consumer products. It began as a product that was deeply enmeshed in Google+, Google\u2019s failed social network. Extricating Hangouts from that fiasco took years. \n\nHangouts also became an integration point for other services like SMS, a live video streaming service, Google Voice, and Project Fi. That sounds good in theory, but in practice, it meant the app\u2019s overall purpose kept changing. One moment, it was an integrated SMS and chat app, and the next, it wasn\u2019t. All the while, the thing began to feel slow and lumbering on phones, and too basic on desktops. \n\nInstead of spinning Hangouts down (it\u2019s honestly too enmeshed in Google\u2019s own internal work culture to do that), Google pivoted it. Hangouts is now an enterprise chat app designed to compete with Slack. \n\nThe next road Google took was more obvious: launch a new, mobile-first texting app and convince people to use it. That app was Allo, which launched two years ago.\n\nAllo is a \u201cfine\u201d app, with all the features you\u2019d expect along with integration with Google Assistant, which launched alongside Allo. \u201cThe strategy behind Allo was \u2018let\u2019s build a really great consumer messaging product really from the ground up,\u2019\u201d Sabharwal says.\n\nBut in 2016 (to say nothing of 2018), simply making a good messaging app wasn\u2019t enough \u2014 not when it has to compete with established giants. Allo also likely suffered from Google messaging app fatigue. People worried it wouldn\u2019t be supported over the long term. (It turns out, they were right.)\n\nIf you\u2019re going to launch a messaging app, you need a good strategy for achieving growth. iMessage worked because it was built right into the iPhone. WhatsApp worked because it was tied to phone numbers and let users avoid paying SMS fees. (And it had the benefit of being the first popular app to take advantage of push notifications.) Facebook Messenger worked because it was built on Facebook.\n\n\u201cThe product as a whole has not achieved the level of traction that we\u2019d hoped for.\u201d \n\nAllo had no such strategy for acquiring users. The closest Google came was a scheme using Google\u2019s own services on Android. When you sent an Allo message to somebody who didn\u2019t have the app installed, they\u2019d receive a Google push notification instead of an SMS. The notification encouraged them to install the app (though they could reply directly without it).\n\nTwo years later, fewer than 50 million Android users have installed Allo. Considering that WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger both clock in at over a billion installs, those numbers just aren\u2019t good enough. As Sabharwal gamely puts it, \u201cThe product as a whole has not achieved the level of traction that we\u2019d hoped for.\u201d \n\nThat means that Google had to admit that the Allo experiment didn\u2019t work. As a result, Sabharwal says that Google is \u201cpausing investment\u201d in Allo. That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s shutting down; Sabharwal says that Google is \u201ccontinuing to support the product.\u201d But if you\u2019re an Allo user, it\u2019s definitely time to start looking elsewhere. My guess is that it\u2019s a dead app walking (or, if you like, texting).\n\nThere\u2019s one other option that I and many others have always hoped Google would have the courage to try: just copy iMessage, but for Android.\n\nThough Google won\u2019t say so, I think that road is fundamentally too dangerous for the company. One would think that Google has more than enough leverage to simply create something that the carriers would have to accept whether they like it or not. What are Verizon and Deutsche Telecom and all the rest going to do, switch to Tizen in protest? Please.\n\nBut the truth is that these carriers have points of leverage over Google that go beyond choosing to sell Android phones. Android is, after all, open source. And though Google can (and does) dictate some requirements in order to include Google services, it can\u2019t dictate them all. A carrier could set Bing as the default search, for example, or set up its own RCS client as the default texting app. \n\nPerhaps Google could have gotten away with a proprietary, baked-in messaging protocol back in 2011 when iMessage launched. But in 2018, carriers aren\u2019t fond of iMessage, and they aren\u2019t going to take kindly to a similar service acting as the default, especially on Android, the globally dominant operating system. Even though it looks like they won\u2019t charge exorbitant SMS prices to consumers, RCS is still preferable to carriers as it will give them the opportunity to sell RCS services to businesses. The GSMA estimates that will be a $74 billion market by 2021. \n\nIn sum, Google tried damn near everything. Only two roads were left: one that would cause all its carrier partners to freak out and one that handed them the keys to a shiny new messaging platform they could call their own.\n\nSabharwal doesn\u2019t paint the decision to partner with carriers in those terms, of course. Instead, he points to Google\u2019s penchant for keeping Android not just open, but neutral. Instead of the nuclear option, Google wants to keep the platform at least nominally neutral. \u201cWe believe that there\u2019s a fundamentally better experience we can deliver to users,\u201d Sabharwal says. He continues:\n\nWe can\u2019t do it without these [carrier and OEM] partners. We don\u2019t believe in taking the approach that Apple does. We are fundamentally an open ecosystem. We believe in working with partners. We believe in working with our OEMs to be able to deliver a great experience.\n\n        Android Messages web client preview.\n\n        Image: Google\n\nThe rollout\n\nSMS is awful. It started as a kind of a hack on top of preexisting cellular systems, and it never really developed much. The Multimedia Messaging Service add-on came later and was equally crappy. These services aren\u2019t just antiquated; they\u2019re expensive. \u201cNo one says \u2018Hey bud hit me up on MMS,\u2019\u201d Sabharwal quips. They say \u201ctext me.\u201d And again, the default texting experience on Android is bad. This is a problem that needs fixing. \n\nSince 2007, the fix was always supposed to be RCS, but RCS hasn\u2019t taken hold for completely predictable reasons. Different carriers developed incompatible versions of the \u201cstandard,\u201d each trying to gain an edge. All the while, they were getting disrupted by tech companies who simply made over-the-top vertically integrated messaging products that just relied on data connections. Talk to nearly any analyst in the tech space, and you\u2019ll find they\u2019re dismissive that RCS could ever work. Here\u2019s Dean Bubley of Disruptive Analysis last year on RCS:\n\nSo ignore it. There are no customers, no use-cases, and no revenues associated with \u201cadvanced messaging\u201d. It\u2019s the same pointless RCS zombie-tech I\u2019ve been accurately predicting would fail for the last decade. It\u2019s still dead, still shambling around and still trying to eat your brain. It\u2019s managed to bite Google and Samsung, and they\u2019ll probably try to infect you as well.\n\nAnd yet, Google has spent the last couple of years trying to get consensus around something called the \u201cUniversal Profile,\u201d a standardized way to make RCS work across carriers. Google\u2019s pitch to carriers is simple: SMS is going to be replaced one way or another. You can either be part of the replacement or continue to watch Apple and Facebook run away with text messaging. \n\nGoogle has also been lining up businesses that want to replace SMS for communicating with customers. Instead of a text message with a short link, you can have your boarding pass or Subway sandwich order or whatever appear right in your texting app. Right now, the best options for businesses that want rich messaging opportunities for customers are iMessage and Facebook \u2014 neither of which are as universal as SMS.  \n\nCarriers have slowly been coming on board. Two big holdouts, AT&T and Verizon, quietly agreed to support the standard in the past few months. Given how fractious the history has been here, I\u2019m sort of impressed that Google got everybody to call this feature \u201cChat\u201d instead of \u201cAT&T super premium advanced messaging plus\u201d or whatever. As of this writing, 55 carriers, 11 OEMs, and two operating system providers have all pledged to either adopt or switch over to the system. \n\n        Android Messages Group Chat Preview.\n\n        Image: Google\n\nThe two operating system providers that have signed on to the Universal Profile: Google and, interestingly, Microsoft. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you can expect a native Chat app in Windows 10, but it does mean it\u2019s possible. Microsoft\u2019s statement on RCS is noncommittal at best: \u201cRCS Universal Profile support for capabilities such as dialer and messaging functionality or other applications is considered on a device-by-device basis, where there is demand for those features.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, we aren\u2019t likely to get one big, splashy moment when Chat \u201cjust works.\u201d I press Sabharwal multiple times on this issue: when are carriers going to switch users over? \u201cI don\u2019t have a crystal ball,\u201d he demurs. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly how long it\u2019s going to be, but we really feel that we are on the cusp of it right now.\u201d Later, he relents and says, \u201cLook, I can speculate, which I think is what you\u2019re asking me to do.\u201d\n\n\u201dBy the end of this year, we\u2019ll be in a really great state, and by mid-next year, we\u2019ll be in a place where a large percentage of users [will have] this experience.\u201d Though, he cautions that \u201cit will differ from country to country\u201d and from region to region. Europe and Latin America are likely to enable it before US carriers. Still, he stresses, \u201cThis is not a three- to five-year play. Our goal is to get this level of quality messaging to our users on Android within the next couple of years.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, Sprint supports Chat right now between compatible Android phones. T-Mobile has promised to do so in Q2 of this year. When I asked for comment, neither Verizon nor AT&T would give me a timeline for when they intend to flip the switch to support Chat.\n\nThe middle period is going to be annoying. If your carrier or your device doesn\u2019t support Chat, you\u2019ll get old-fashioned SMS and MMS messages \u2014 and vice versa. Importantly, that means that iPhone users won\u2019t be part of this ecosystem. \n\nBut I have a hunch that the pressure is on to get Apple to support Chat, not just from Google but from carriers and other businesses. Sources familiar with RCS say Google, along with multiple mobile operators, is in discussion with Apple about supporting RCS. Apple declined to comment.\n\nCarrier control\n\nIf you\u2019re still trying to wrap your head around the idea that Google won\u2019t have a standalone consumer chat app, well, so am I. \u201cThe fundamental thesis behind the RCS protocol is it\u2019s a carrier service,\u201d Sabharwal says. That means that the carriers will be the final arbiters of what Chat can and can\u2019t do \u2014 and whether it will be successful. The good news is that Google appears to have herded all the carrier cats into a box where their Chat services will actually be interoperable. \n\nRight now, the expectation is that carriers won\u2019t charge SMS-style rates for Chat messages. \u201cMessages will work just like any other IP-based messaging protocol. So, in that respect, it\u2019ll just be \u2018free\u2019 and part of your data plan,\u201d Sabharwal says. That\u2019s probably true, but it\u2019s definitely outside Google\u2019s control. Any communication standard that depends on the largess of wireless carriers is inherently at risk of getting messed up in dozens of ways, including price.\n\n        The companies that support the RCS Universal Profile as of April 2018.\n\n        Image: GSMA\n\nThe worse news is that carriers aren\u2019t fond of strong encryption and don\u2019t have a great history of pushing back against government demands for information. \n\n\u201dRCS continues to be a carrier-owned service, so legal intercept and other laws that exist that allow carriers to have access to the data continues to be the case,\u201d Sabharwal admits. And though Google isn\u2019t shutting down Allo, it\u2019s also not working to create a chat service that is as secure as iMessage, Signal, or even Telegram. \u201cAt this point, the answer is no. We will not have that option,\u201d Sabharwal says. Allo offers an \u201cincognito\u201d mode that does support end-to-end encryption, but that\u2019s it.\n\nFor a company that has a reputation for rapaciously collecting user data and then turning that data into ads and services, it\u2019s surprising to hear that Google doesn\u2019t want an owned-and-operated chat app. Basically, it sounds like Sabharwal doesn\u2019t think it has to. And it may not have an alternative: the company hasn\u2019t been able to find a way to make an owned-and-operated chat app succeed in nearly a decade.\n\n\u201dI don\u2019t want to say that were \u2018ceding messaging\u2019 [to the carriers],\u201d Sabharwal says. Instead, Google believes that it can deliver Google services inside the Android Messages app. It won\u2019t control the transport of those messages, but it can improve the user experience by building the app itself.\n\n        Smart reply in Android Messages preview.\n\n        Image: Google\n\nSo expect a couple things to happen on the app front. First, Google will finally make a desktop web interface for texting. At least in the initial version, you\u2019ll authorize it with a QR code, much as you do with WhatsApp. That makes it essentially an extension of your phone, like the WhatsApp client, so the only message history it\u2019ll have is what is on your phone. \n\nSecond, expect the Android Messages app to rapidly acquire more features. With luck, its development won\u2019t stagnate like Hangouts did. It\u2019s worth keeping an eye on, because some features can be developed in the app itself and others may require coordinating work with all the carriers on the Chat standard itself.\n\nSabharwal can explain the nuances of RCS hubs, carrier negotiations, and Google\u2019s own (optional) Jibe RCS cloud services. But more than any of that, he\u2019s eager to talk about the features he wants to bring to Android Messages. Smart replies. Google Assistant. Integration with his other project, Google Photos. Clearer organization of messages. Better search. More \u201cexpressiveness\u201d (read: GIFs and stickers). \n\nAt the end of the day, users care about those features. They care about having \u201cblue bubbles,\u201d those cultural indicators that you\u2019re having a conversation in a channel that isn\u2019t limited to 160-character messages hurled into the void. Google\u2019s path to getting those features to the 2 billion-plus Android users around the world has been rocky, to put it mildly. \n\nThe rollout of Chat could be equally rocky. Some carriers will hold out either through obstinacy or inability. Some Android phones may also be left out, depending on their manufacturer. There are risks that infighting between all the companies trying to work together could collapse the whole effort. And, especially in the US, nobody really knows if or when Apple will bow to pressure to support RCS. (Apple, as you\u2019re surely aware, isn\u2019t one to bow to pressure.)\n\nAfter talking about all that, Sabharwal finally lets me take a look at a presentation showing an upcoming version of Android Messages. It has all the features he\u2019s hoping to deliver. The messages delivered over Chat happened to be blue. But that was just happenstance: one of the features of Android Messages is that you can pick a custom color for your chat messages, depending on whom you\u2019re speaking with. This is Android, after all, and Android is all about customization.\n\nCustomization is messy. Android is messy. So it makes sense that the ultimate fix for Android messaging wasn\u2019t to eliminate messiness, but to embrace it.\n",
