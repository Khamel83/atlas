      "Title": "Rhetoric scholars pinpoint why Trump\u2019s inarticulate speaking style is so persuasive Quartz",
      "Selection": "President Donald Trump does not sound like a traditionally impressive orator. His sentences are grammatically awkward, repetitive, and composed of highly simplistic words.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks when he announced his campaign for presidency presents a typical example of his rambling, incoherent speaking style:\n\n\u201cI will build a great wall\u2014and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me\u2014and I\u2019ll build them very inexpensively,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cOur country is in serious trouble,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don\u2019t have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating\u2014let\u2019s say China\u2014in a trade deal? I beat China all the time. All the time.\u201d\n\nThe speech was met with widespread derision yet, less than a year later, Trump got the votes to become president of the United States.\n\nRichard Wilson, a professor of anthropology and law at UConn School of Law who has studied the language of demagogues worldwide, says that it\u2019s not uncommon for populist politicians to speak in such a clunky style.\n\n\u201cThey use unusual speech patterns and ungrammatical phrases and long pauses\u2014and it kind of pulls you in,\u201d he says. Wilson notes that when he conducted a psychological survey on the speeches of Serbian politician Vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj, who was acquitted of war crimes at The Hague last year, the Serbian translator immediately noted \u0160e\u0161elj\u2019s poor grammar. \u201c[\u0160e\u0161elj] has a Ph.D,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cBut when he comes to give a speech, he uses a particular type of language. I think Trump is doing the same. It\u2019s what makes him stand apart from other politicians.\u201d\n\nThere are two reasons, says Wilson, this style of speech is effective: \u201cThey [populists] want to speak like regular folks and so they often use phrases that are ungrammatical so as to seem popular,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut they also do it because it forces us to listen more closely.\u201d\n\nBecause Trump\u2019s style is so confusing, audiences have to pay closer attention to make sense of his words. And this focus means listeners are more likely to be persuaded, just as you\u2019re more likely to be convinced by a lecturer if you pay close attention rather than let her words drift over you.\n\nIt\u2019s not foolproof, of course\u2014listeners can still use their judgment to evaluate a speech\u2014but it does give an advantage. After all, says Wilson, \u201cIf you\u2019re listening to someone more intensely, then you\u2019re more likely to be persuaded by that than if you\u2019re not listening to them.\u201d\n\nEdward Schiappa, professor of rhetoric and media at MIT, notes that Trump\u2019s simplicity of language is appealing to some. \u201cTrump\u2019s prepared speeches are pedestrian,\u201d he writes in an email. The president\u2019s language is what rhetorical critics call \u201cplain style,\u201d says Schiappa, and \u201cprobably accounts for Trump\u2019s popularity among the less educated citizens who prefer the sort of simplicity we saw from George Bush.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s simple speaking style also gives the impression that politics is straightforward. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t have time or the inclination to do much research or thought about certain topics think they can be solved simply\u2014\u2019build a wall,\u2019 \u2018bomb the hell out of them,\u2019 \u2018buy American,\u2019\u201d says Schiappa. \u201cThese are simple ideas that seem to address problems that bother a lot of people. \u201c\n\nThough Trump speaks quite unlike great orators of the past, in some ways he does fulfill ancient rhetorical ideas of what makes a strong speaker. \u201cAristotle talked about this 2000 years ago,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cHe talks about ethos, which refers to the credibility of the speaker.\u201d\n\nWhereas most politicians signify their credibility by displaying their experience or reasoning, Trump shows his credibility through an outspoken, honest-sounding style. Wilson says Trump\u2019s speaking style sends the signal that he goes \u201cwith his gut.\u201d This gives Trump the freedom to change his mind, and also means he\u2019s seen as a clear departure from traditional politics.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s also a master at Aristotle\u2019s notion of pathos, namely influencing the emotions of his audience. \u201cTrump does read very successfully the emotional state of his base, which at this point is angry,\u201d says Wilson.\n\nTrump has other speaking habits that are often seen in demagogues, says Wilson, such as repetition and disgust. Wilson notes Trump shows disgust in his comments about women, such as his remarks about Megan Kelly and Hillary Clinton, and in how he talks about Mexicans. Disgust is a powerful emotional tool in creating an in group, and scapegoating outsiders by blaming them for any problems.\n\nAll politicians use repetition as a rhetorical technique, but Trump takes it to the extreme. This incessant repetition means that even totally groundless statements are reported in the media. Wilson points to Trump\u2019s repeated remarks about Clinton\u2019s emails as an example of how repetition can be effective. \u201cIt was continually repeated, again and again, by Trump,\u201d he says. \u201cTo the point where people think, \u2018I keep hearing it, so something must be there.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut while Trump\u2019s rhetoric might have won him supporters, Schiappa says it\u2019s far from mature language, or a sign of someone who can create strong policy.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s unprepared speaking is frightening in its incoherence,\u201d he says. His language is lazy, Schiappa notes\u2014for example, Trump frequently uses the word \u201cvery\u201d instead of simply coming up with a stronger adjective.\n\n\u201cSince the time of the ancient Greeks, one\u2019s spoken words have been seen as an expression of one\u2019s inward thoughts and intellectual capacity,\u201d says Schiappa. \u201cI think that is why so many critics are worried about Trump, because his words suggest a very simplistic mind that may not be up to the challenges of the presidency in the 21st century.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n",
