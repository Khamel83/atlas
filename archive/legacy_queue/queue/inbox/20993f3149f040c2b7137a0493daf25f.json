      "Title": "In a job interview, this is how to acknowledge your weaknesses Quartz",
      "Selection": "Two years ago, a young woman named Michele Hansen spotted a job opening that piqued her interest. She wasn\u2019t qualified\u2014the posting was for a product manager at an investment company, and she had no experience in financial services.\n\nIn that situation, the voice in your head screams for self-promotion. If you\u2019re applying for a job, you know you need to bend over backward to hide your shortcomings. As an interviewer, when I ask candidates to name their biggest weaknesses, they usually respond with strengths in disguise. I work too hard. I\u2019m too much of a perfectionist. I only won a silver medal in the Olympics.\n\nBut Michele Hansen did the exact opposite. She took a page out of George Costanza\u2019s playbook on Seinfeld: \u201cMy name is George. I\u2019m unemployed and I live with my parents.\u201d Instead of trying to hide her limitations, she led with them:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably not the candidate you\u2019ve been envisioning,\u201d her cover letter began. \u201cI don\u2019t have a decade of experience as a Product Manager nor am I a Certified Financial Planner.\u201d\n\nHansen got the job. And she isn\u2019t alone. In one study, interviewers gave the highest ratings to business school applicants who were more concerned with being seen accurately than positively. In another study, Harvard researchers asked undergraduates to answer a job interview question about their weaknesses. Only 23% gave actual negative qualities: I procrastinate. I overreact to situations. The other 77% hid their weaknesses inside a humblebrag: I\u2019m too nice. I\u2019m too demanding when it comes to fairness. When collaborators reviewed the answers, they were 30% more interested in hiring the candidates who acknowledged a legitimate weakness.\n\nAlthough applicants believe self-promotion is the ticket to landing a coveted job, the evidence shows otherwise. Undergraduates who played up their skills and accomplishments were not significantly more likely to get job offers. Executives who tried to impress board members with their qualifications did not succeed in landing more board seats. And employees who went out of their way to highlight their successes had substantially lower salaries and promotion rates. Compared to flattery and favors, researchers James Westphal and Ithai Stern explain, \u201cself-promotion is less consistently effective\u2026 it is less subtle and more transparent.\u201d\n\nIn a pair of experiments, Alison Fragale and I found that self-promotion only paid off when the audience was distracted enough to remember the information but forget the source. Otherwise, they saw right through it: \u201cIf you were that great, you wouldn\u2019t need to boast about your greatness.\u201d\n\nOf course, you can\u2019t get a job if you only focus on your inadequacies. After confessing her lack of relevant experience, Michele Hansen devoted the rest of her cover letter to explaining why she had the motivation and skills to succeed anyway. \u201cI don\u2019t wait for people to tell me what to do and go seek for myself what needs to be done,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m entrepreneurial, I get things done\u2026 I love breaking new ground and starting with a blank slate.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s evidence for a backlash against female self-promoters. Trumpeting accomplishments violates gender stereotypes of women as communal rather than assertive and ambitious. (This helps explain Nate Silver\u2019s finding that Hillary Clinton\u2019s approval ratings go up every time she holds an office and down when she\u2019s vying for one.) Michele Hansen overcame that backlash by establishing her deficiencies up front with candor and humility. As a result, her comments about her strengths came across as more credible.\n\nBy admitting your inadequacies, you show that you\u2019re self-aware enough to know your areas for improvement\u2014and secure enough to be open about them. That you\u2019re interested in being hired for what you actually bring to the table, not what you pretend to bring.\n\nIn 1987, the Chicago Sun-Times had to replace their beloved advice columnist, Ann Landers. A young journalist, Jeff Zaslow, was writing an article about the search and decided to throw his hat in the ring. \u201cHow could you have the audacity to give advice?\u201d an interviewer scoffed. \u201cI may only be 28,\u201d Zaslow replied, \u201cbut I have the wisdom of a 29-year old.\u201d\n\nThey hired him.\n\nThis post originally appeared on LinkedIn.
