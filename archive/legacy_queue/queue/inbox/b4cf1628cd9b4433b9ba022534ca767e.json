      "Title": "A venture capitalist explains how to become insanely well-connected Quartz",
      "Selection": "Fall 1996. A young Chris Fralic is selling software for Oracle. He\u2019s not sure what he wants to do next, but he\u2019s always been curious about venture capital. And then some unusual magic happens\u2014a friend offers to introduce him to Kevin Compton, a vaunted name in VC. To his surprise, they talk on the phone for over an hour, and Fralic not only walks away with a comprehensive download on the industry, but a thesis on networking he\u2019s adhered to ever since: The best way to be highly influential is to be human to everyone you meet.\n\nFast forward to today, Fralic is a successful VC himself, responsible for First Round\u2019s investments in Warby Parker, Roblox, HotelTonight and Adaptly among others. When asked what\u2019s made his career possible, he\u2019ll tell you outright it\u2019s the relationships\u2014built deliberately over many years. This might sound like a common response, but among his peers, he\u2019s acknowledged to be a world-class super-connector with rarefied expertise. Known for helping launch the famed TED Talks (this is his 24th year attending TED), and a landmark Forbes piece on nailing email introductions, Fralic still responds thoughtfully to over 10,000 emails every year.\n\nIn this piece, he unpacks the strategies that have earned him this reputation\u2014including how to become a genuine and highly-connective networker, how to propel your career forward with each interaction (while doing the same for others), do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for getting responses from influencers in your industry, and how to regularly measure your performance in this area so it becomes a competitive advantage.\n\nFralic\u2019s seven rules for making memorable connections\n\n\u2018Add value in conversations\u2019 is typical advice. This means making sure people walk away with a new idea, referral, intro, etc. But Fralic has found imparting energy to be even more important than sharing new information. To do this, follow these seven rules:\n\n1. Convey genuine appreciation.\nActively project warmth and high energy. It\u2019s been observed people like you when they feel liked by you. So, do you greet them in a way that sounds like you\u2019re genuinely happy to see them? To make it clear you\u2019re interested in the other person, think about what they know that you don\u2019t. What do you actually want to learn in the interaction? Focus on that so that they can walk away knowing they added value too.\n\n2. Listen with intent.\nThe focus you bring to asking specific questions about what\u2019s being said in real time makes others feel heard. This is a big one. Being a good listener is about two things: 1) Demonstrating that you\u2019ve heard exactly what was said by the other person, and 2) encouraging them to continue. This breaks down into what\u2019s called \u201cbackchanneling\u201d\u2014offering short, enthusiastic responses as the other person talks (i.e. \u201cyeah\u201d \u201cmm-hmm\u201d \u201ctotally\u201d \u201cI can see that\u201d), and asking follow up questions that reference the information you were just given.\n\nYou\u2019d be surprised how often people flub on listening, says Fralic. People\u2019s minds wander, they\u2019ll be nodding but thinking about what\u2019s for dinner, they might look past the person speaking to see who else is in the room. All of this projects disinterest, a lack of value or prioritization for the person, and that can only hurt the relationship. If you\u2019re talking on the phone, asking specific follow-ups becomes even more important with no body language or eye contact to read.\n\n3. Use humility markers.\nWhat you say and how you say it can put others at ease and replace nerves with positive energy\u2014even in tough situations. \u201cI have relationships that have lasted over a decade that started with me meeting a founding team and not investing,\u201d says Fralic. \u201cI\u2019ll often start that conversation saying, \u2018I\u2019m wrong all the time and I very well may be here.\u2019\u201d Acknowledging your own fallibility and human imperfection can go a long way toward making yourself relatable. Especially if there\u2019s a power dynamic where someone is asking for your advice, attention or help, you want to put the other person at ease.\n\nThere\u2019s an unspoken distinction in the networking world between the Hunters and the Hunted.\n\nWhen Fralic reached out to Kevin Compton all those years ago. He was approaching one of the \u2018hunted\u2019\u2014someone who had 1,000 other things to be thinking about. But he still took the time to engage and it was never forgotten.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to build yourself up any more or explain why you\u2019re important or going to be helpful. Your focus should be on building bridges between your experience and theirs so there are points of recognition, especially if you can organically work in shared struggles or challenges.\n\nTaking the time to call or meet in person also expresses humility\u2014which is paramount if you\u2019re about to reject someone. You want to emphasize that your time is no more important than theirs. \u201cI like to call to explain opportunities I\u2019ve passed on versus emailing. A rejection stands out among people\u2019s interactions. When you take the time to be conscientious and human, people are often appreciative and will respect you more.\u201d\n\n4. Offer unvarnished honesty.\nThere are a lot of reasons why people don\u2019t share what they truly think in professional situations. They don\u2019t want to tarnish relationships or endure an uncomfortable exchange or risk being disliked. Even if you\u2019re one of the \u2018Hunted,\u2019 it\u2019s human nature to avoid these experiences. You can differentiate yourself by being as honest as you can. Just remember to root your honesty in what will actually have utility for the other party. This will set a good tone for all future conversations.\n\n5. Blue-sky brainstorm.\nMaybe you can\u2019t provide what someone is looking for. But, if you can change the angle or way they\u2019re thinking about something by openly brainstorming with them, you make them feel like they got something special and unexpected. It\u2019s key that you\u2019re brainstorming with them, not for them. So, in the example of passing on an investment, Fralic makes a point of listing others who might invest, or he spends time thinking through how they might pitch or message their business differently.\n\nIt\u2019s best when the conversation builds on itself. He\u2019ll suggest a few names or changes, and then provide a sounding board for any concerns or questions the founders might have. This way, he can help them find a new, albeit slightly different path forward, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ll remember\u2014not just the no.\n\nGive before thinking about what you get. Always offer something of value before expecting or asking for something in return. Key to this is not focusing on reciprocity.\n\n\u201cIf you find yourself keeping score in your professional relationships, you\u2019re on the wrong track.\u201d\n\nInstead make a list of everything you feel comfortable offering others (even if you get nothing back). Perhaps you provide connections or advice or office space or a next step in a process. That way, if you have to say no to one thing, there\u2019s still energy you can contribute.\n\n6. End every meeting or conversation with the feeling and optimism you\u2019d like to have at the start of your next conversation with the person.\n\u201cAssume you\u2019re going to run into everyone again\u2014it usually happens either by plan or happenstance,\u201d says Fralic. \u201cThere are no closed connections. The world is too small.\u201d When you do meet again, you want the person to think, \u2018Oh great, it\u2019s so-and-so!\u2019 not \u2018I guess I\u2019ll get through this somehow.\u2019 If you envision running into this person again and how you want that to go, it\u2019ll undoubtedly influence how you navigate a present conversation\u2014usually for the better.\n\nFor example, Fralic is always impressed by founders who\u2014when turned down\u2014send some variation of, \u201cThanks for looking even if it\u2019s not a fit. If you have other ideas for us or if anything changes, please let me know,\u201d or, \u201cChris, when we met, you had a question/issue about X. I just wanted to show you what we\u2019ve done about it\u2014no need to respond.\u201d \u201cA person who says that shows she\u2019s savvy enough to not take bad news personally, or create obligation or awkwardness, or continue to argue their point after you\u2019ve said no. I\u2019ll remember her for it,\u201d he says.\n\nThere\u2019s time beyond this fundraise and even this company. Relationships take years to build. Start now.\n\n7. Don\u2019t fake it till you make it.\nIt may be common wisdom for finding confidence, but it has some negative byproducts. Namely, Fralic has seen it used to justify winging it in important meetings. Faking it in this context doesn\u2019t mean bluffing your way through interactions that make you feel insecure or intimidated. That leads to bad decision making.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen people overstate their credentials because they were put on the spot, or blindly target every executive in a room because they figured they should,\u201d he says. \u201cThis rarely leads to long-lasting relationships.\u201d If you want to connect with someone professionally to move your goals forward, you need to know exactly why you care about that person or their company. And you need to know how to articulate it succinctly. Everyone seems to have a story about a cold call miraculously turning into a career-making breakthrough. This doesn\u2019t happen by magic. It happens because your sincerity is clearly powered by diligent preparation.\n\nIf you know you\u2019re headed into a call or event and want to make a good impression on certain people, create mini dossiers for them. All it takes is a few bullet points:\n\nWhat are the key milestones in their career?\n\nWhat expertise do they seemingly love to provide? (Possible to suss out from any articles that quote them or talks they\u2019ve given in the past.)\n\nAre there any recent news stories or announcements about them?\n\nWhat do you want to ask them or get out of the interaction if you get the chance?\n\nJust knowing this much will give you a leg up in the moment as long as you\u2019re honest, straightforward, and have a clear objective.\n\n\u201cPeople approach me through email with \u2018faux familiarity\u2019 all the time, saying, \u2018Hey how have you been? It\u2019s been awhile!\u2019 Nope. It\u2019s been never. Just say you don\u2019t have a connection and make a compelling argument for why we should meet, i.e. \u2018You don\u2019t know me but you\u2019ve done X and Y, would you be willing to tell me what you think of Z.\u2019 It might not work but it has a far better chance.\u201d\n\nBuild long-thriving (not just lasting) relationships\u2014the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts\n\nOnce you\u2019ve made a strong first impression, it\u2019s up to you to turn that one touchpoint into a connection that has mutual purpose and positive impact. This is where a lot of people fumble: They get too busy, disorganized, nervous or pessimistic to follow up the right way. The result: too many high-potential relationships fizzle for no good reason. Here\u2019s a sure-footed way to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen to you.\n\nDO: Keep your \u2018dream contact list\u2019 at the ready\n\nWhen Fralic was in the computer reselling business, he kept stacks of trade journals that listed the names of top people in the industry. He would go through and mark those he wanted to learn more from\u2014and, by hook or by crook (pre-LinkedIn), find a way to connect. Once he did, he\u2019d ask if they could introduce him to the others on his list.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want your network to look like, and what are you trying to achieve? For example, I tell our founders that there should always be a slide in their board decks that shows the five most likely acquirers of their business and what they\u2019ve done to further those relationships since the last board meeting\u201d Fralic says.\n\n\u201cThe same goes for relationships with individuals. If you know who your top 5 dream contacts are and what you want to talk to them about, you\u2019ll be ready when you run into someone who knows them. Likewise, it\u2019s good to have a forcing function for keeping those connections healthy\u2014much like the board deck slide, consider creating a rolling reminder to get in touch. As a company, you want to have a relationship with potential acquirers before you call up asking, \u2018Do you want to buy us?\u2019 As a person, you want to have a relationship before you ask for a job, an intro, money.\u201d\n\nDO: Craft low-lift requests\n\nMake sure your asks are reasonable for the busiest of people. First, keep your emails short, simple, and to the point. Second, \u201cIf you send an email asking for something, do the first three steps of thinking for them. Make it really easy for the other person to say yes or no without creating an imposition. For example if you\u2019re asking for an intro, write a self-contained forwardable email,\u201d Fralic says. A good SCFE (as he sometimes calls it) has a subject line customized for the end recipient and quickly explains who you are, what you want and why\u2014it\u2019s dead simple for your mutual contact to send along. Here\u2019s a real-life example:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDate: February 21, 2017 at 8:55:26 AM ESTSubject: Introduction to HUNTED PERSON\n\nHi Chris,\nThanks again for our discussion on Friday.\n\nI appreciate your offer to introduce me to [HUNTED PERSON], to explore if there may be sales leadership roles within [COMPANY] where I can share the valuable experience I gained building [MY LAST COMPANY]\u2019s saas business.\n\nMy CV is attached to this note. I\u2019ll keep you advised with my progress.\n\nBest regards,\n[HUNTER]\n\n[FULL NAME\nEMAIL ADDRESS\nPHONE NUMBER]\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAlways include your phone number in case the person you\u2019re trying to get in touch with would find it easier to just call you directly. Few people do this. It\u2019s uniquely self aware.\n\nBe really sure of the time commitment you ask from someone. Do you really need that much? \u201cIf your outreach is just, \u2018Can I take you to lunch?\u2019 that\u2019s a big ask for a lot of people versus, \u2018Hey, just thought I\u2019d share with you this quick update about what I\u2019m doing. No need to respond.\u2019 The \u2018no need to respond\u2019 is a powerful tool. It sounds counterintuitive, but if you give people an out, it makes them more likely to act,\u201d says Fralic. If you\u2019re aware and respectful of how busy a person must be, they\u2019ll assume positive data about your emotional intelligence and social skills, which could get you further than eating lunch with them in the long run.\n\nDO: Follow up and follow through\n\nIt sounds so easy\u2014just follow up after meetings and complete any deliverables you promised. But a shocking number of people don\u2019t, Fralic says.\n\nActually doing what you say you\u2019re going to do will put you in the top quartile.\n\n\u201cI recently met with Kenny Herman, who used to work for a First Round company and is one of the best business development people out there. In a meeting, he kept coming up with ideas for people to introduce me to and said he\u2019d send over a list that I could choose from,\u201d Fralic says. \u201cAfterwards, he actually did send me an email with LinkedIn links to all of the people he\u2019d brainstormed and one-line details on who they were. With it came a short note offering to make introductions. That\u2019s the perfect follow up. Nine out of 10 people don\u2019t do that. Instead, most people just drop off or forget. Not only does the relationship stop there, but I\u2019ll never use the word reliable to describe them.\u201d\n\nThese days, there\u2019s tons of chatter about building one\u2019s personal brand. Ironically, your brand actually comes from you doing great, consistent work on time\u2014not from investing in social media or a website or marketing your work, says Fralic. You have tools at your disposal to surprise and delight: speed and polish. If you can follow up fast, that\u2019ll get you noticed\u2014even better if your content is perfectly proofread and detailed.\n\nDO: Make your own system for keeping in touch\n\nFralic uses Contactually to organize his contacts and gets regular reminders to email the people he\u2019s marked as wanting to touch base with frequently. \u201cA venture capitalist I admire used to recruit a friend of mine like clockwork\u2014he would inevitably call every single year to see if he would join their firm. It worked. He eventually did. The takeaway: you\u2019re only human, you can\u2019t remember everyone, let a system do what you can\u2019t.\u201d Expensive software isn\u2019t required to create a CRM for your life. All you need is a system that will:\n\nStore people\u2019s names and relevant data like email address, birthday, company, title, relevant personal or business facts that won\u2019t make you sound disingenuous. Don\u2019t ask about someone\u2019s kids if you don\u2019t know them that well.\n\nPing you when X days, weeks, months or years have gone by to remind you to reconnect however appropriate, depending on the nature of the relationship.\n\nIt could be as simple a creating a Reminder for each contact on your Mac that will send you a push notification every 3, 6 or 12 months. This also allows you to put their email address and any short details in the \u2018note\u2019 section and access contacts across devices.\n\n\u201cAfter a meeting, I\u2019ll quickly save a one-minute audio note with takeaways and next steps,\u201d says Fralic. \u201cI then set aside an hour every Friday to go through these notes and write corresponding follow-ups if I haven\u2019t already.\u201d A good meeting recap email can inspire tremendous confidence. Consider sending along a few short bullets capturing the most important points discussed, along with a list of primary action items and who is responsible for them. This will make everyone feel more organized, clear-headed and certain progress is being made\u2014essentially you\u2019re adding energy to an interaction over email.\n\nOf course, while systems are important, don\u2019t let them prevent you from being spontaneous. If you stumble on an article that\u2019s highly relevant to something a valuable contact is doing or thinking about, send it along with a quick personalized note.\n\nIf you can add one \u2018Incremental Thoughtful Personal\u2019 email or call per day, do it. It can fundamentally impact your business and relationships in the long term.\n\nDO: Special Ops-level recon\n\nFralic is meticulous about using tools and elbow grease to ready himself for meetings. Every appointment on his daily agenda includes a link to a person\u2019s LinkedIn, plus a few sentences on who made the introduction and the purpose of the meeting. On busy days, he\u2019ll list out key questions and takeaways for each meeting. He\u2019s also a fan of Clearbit, which makes a Gmail widget that surfaces context on people in your address book.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much information available, yet people don\u2019t take advantage of it. When I get an email or have a sit-down, you\u2019d be surprised at how few people can give evidence that they\u2019ve done any real work in advance. There\u2019s just no excuse for that,\u201d Fralic says. \u201cI\u2019ll meet candidates who are interested in jobs at our startups and I\u2019ll ask, \u2018What companies are interesting to you?\u2019 Half the time they\u2019ll say, \u2018I haven\u2019t had a chance to look at your website yet.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis is a low bar. Set a higher standard. It\u2019s worth doing a Google search for tools to discover, capture, and make information about people accessible. This is the bread of butter of services like Accompany, and many others that make investigative legwork easy. You can set Google Alerts for your top 5 contacts, for instance, so you catch every news story they or their company is mentioned in. There are even IFTTT recipes devoted to keeping tabs on your contacts. Don\u2019t accept the standard tools. Go the extra mile to find out more, be better prepared, and keep in touch.\n\nDO: Get to the \u2018Zone of Indifference\u2019\n\nWhen you approach meaningful outreach, or a sales pitch, or fundraising, or a new job opportunity, make sure you prepare as much as you can. You\u2019re aiming for the \u2018Zone of Indifference.\u2019 That\u2019s where you can look yourself in the eye and know you did everything you could to make it happen. When you\u2019re in the Zone, it\u2019s great if you achieve your goal, but if you don\u2019t, you spare yourself the regret, doubt or stress you might have otherwise.\n\nOn a related note, it\u2019s always better to get a quick \u2018no.\u2019 Leave it all on the field, so you make a good impression. If and when things don\u2019t go your way, learn from what happened. It\u2019s better to get that \u2018no\u2019 upfront than to get strung along waiting for a yes that never comes.\n\nDON\u2019T: Ambush people (always ask first)\n\nAs your network grows, you can start providing value in the form of introductions for others. But there\u2019s no easier way to burn a bridge than to send an email connecting two people without getting their permission first. Double opt-in emails are a must. If a contact asks to meet someone, shoot that person a quick email explaining who the requester is and why you think it could be a valuable interaction for them. Don\u2019t just paste their bio. If you do, you\u2019ll miss out appearing like the thoughtful strategist who put two and two together. You want both recipients to know you\u2019ve got their back and you\u2019re on the lookout for opportunities to benefit them. And don\u2019t forget to always give everyone involved an out. Don\u2019t create an obligation.\n\nDON\u2019T: Reach out only when you need something\n\nThis can happen by accident or if you feel like you have no other choice. This is why the tools Fralic mentioned earlier are so handy. But let\u2019s say you need to make a decision on the fly. \u201cCheck your \u201dSent folder to see when\u2019s the last time you reached out to someone and in what context before you fire off that note asking for help,\u201d he says. \u201cIt becomes obvious very quickly when someone just wants to use you. Don\u2019t be one of those people. This is a quick way to suffer single-digit response rates\u2014if you\u2019re just asking people for things without thinking about what you\u2019ve done for them recently, or without any context for why you\u2019re asking, people will feel imposed upon. And they won\u2019t respond. Your reputation takes a hit and everybody loses.\u201d\n\nDON\u2019T: Lose track of your response rate\n\nYou don\u2019t want your response rate be at 100%, because then you\u2019re not pushing far enough\u2014you could probably ask for more assistance and still get it. \u201cMy goal is roughly an 80% hit rate for outreach,\u201d says Fralic. \u201cFor others in different roles it might be lower (if you\u2019re a sales development rep for instance) or maybe 50%. There\u2019s no magic number, but your response rate should make sense based on the strength of connection and amount of personalization and thought you\u2019ve put into the outreach.\u201d\n\nVery few people even pay attention to this metric, so they don\u2019t know where they stand. Learn from past emails to make future ones better. Let\u2019s say you send 20 emails out to close connections asking for candidates for an open role. Tally your response rate. Think about who didn\u2019t respond. Rephrase similar asks to them in the future that might appeal more to their specific interests or personalities. It\u2019s worth your time given the value that can be gained.\n\nEmail response rates are signals of your reputation. Under 10%? You\u2019ve got a problem.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re only as good as the people you know,\u201d says Fralic. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so worth it to make your reputation a priority. Your brand is what people think or say about you when you\u2019re not around. When they see your name in their inbox, think about what you want their first reaction to be,\u201d Fralic says. \u201cIf you follow these principles, your network will naturally widen into a solid foundation. It\u2019s not just about having another high-caliber LinkedIn connection or the email address of a VIP. Those are nice to have, sure, but the real win is knowing those people will respond to you when you need it.\u201d\n\nThis article was first published at First Round Review.
