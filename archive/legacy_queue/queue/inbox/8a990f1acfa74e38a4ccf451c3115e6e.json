      "Title": "The controversy over Ilhan Omar and AIPAC money, explained Vox - All",
      "Selection": "It\u2019s only somewhat about the Benjamins. \n \nHouse Republicans don\u2019t have a policy agenda that they\u2019re planning to wield to win back the House from Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats, but they do have a new favored wedge issue: Israel. Republicans, led by Rep. Kevin McCarthy, are accusing two new Muslim members of Congress, who\u2019ve made strident criticisms of Israel, of anti-Semitism.\n\nThe specifics of the controversy of the moment (\u201cOmar ignites new anti-Semitism controversy with comments on AIPAC,\u201d according to Politico) relate to some moderately ill-advised tweets Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) fired off Sunday night. But the tweets themselves only arose in the larger context of what was already a push from Republican leaders to label Omar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) as anti-Semitic over their views on Israel policy. That\u2019s not a novel tactic to anyone familiar with the discourse around this subject, but it\u2019s taken on a new urgency in the current Congress for two parallel reasons. \n\nFirst, under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the government of Israel has become increasingly comfortable with the concept of Israel being used as a partisan wedge issue \u2014 something Israeli leaders traditionally felt would undermine Israel\u2019s political support in the United States. \n\nSecond, as part of a larger resurgence of left-wing politics in the United States, a minority of Democrats are becoming increasingly comfortable with overt hostility to the Israeli government \u2014 and at least some establishment Democrats, stung by Netanyahu\u2019s conduct during President Obama\u2019s eight years in office, are prepared to back them. \n\nNonetheless, the issue of Israel remains deeply \u2014 indeed, almost uniquely \u2014 divisive in the Democratic Party. After about twelve hours of controversy, Omar\u2019s remarks led to a remarkable joint rebuke from the entire House Democratic leadership team calling them \u201cdeeply offensive.\u201d\n\nOmar, in turn, apologized for the phrasing of her tweet while standing behind the substantive criticism of AIPAC\u2019s policy agenda. \n\nListening and learning, but standing strong pic.twitter.com/7TSroSf8h1\n\u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) February 11, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, the pro-Israel establishment in the American Jewish community remains determined to flex considerable financial muscle in favor of its preferred policy approach while simultaneously accusing those like Omar who draw attention to this fact of trafficking in anti-Semitic stereotypes.\n\nIlhan Omar\u2019s Sunday night twitter controversy\n\nIt all began, as so many things do these days, with public figures being Extremely Online during non-working hours. \n\nAfter years of tolerating Iowa Rep. Steve King\u2019s increasingly overt racism, McCarthy took action against him early this year by stripping him of his committee assignments. Then on Sunday, Ron Kampeas of the JTA news service reported that McCarthy was preparing to challenge Democrats to take similar action against Omar and Tlaib, arguing, according to Kampeas, that \u201cstatements by freshmen Democrats Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota were equal to King\u2019s and \u2018more so.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear from Kampeas\u2019s report which statements he had in mind, but in the larger context of the GOP push for laws that would punish people for boycotting Israel, it seems like he was trying to say that Omar and Tlaib supporting the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement was worthy of punishment. \n\nThat led Glenn Greenwald, a prominent journalist and critic of both Israel and BDS laws, to send a tweet. \n\nGOP Leader Kevin McCarthy threatens punishment for @IlhanMN and @RashidaTlaib over their criticisms of Israel. It's stunning how much time US political leaders spend defending a foreign nation even if it means attacking free speech rights of Americans https://t.co/It1fGm1b70\n\u2014 Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) February 10, 2019\n\nThen Omar followed up on Greenwald by saying that McCarthy\u2019s approach to this issue was \u201call about the Benjamins baby\u201d (i.e., motivated by money). \n\nIt's all about the Benjamins baby https://t.co/KatcXJnZLV\n\u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) February 10, 2019\n\nOffered an opportunity to clarify by Batya Ungar-Sargon, the opinion editor for the Forward, Omar instead upped the ante to say clearly that she believes the American Israel Public Affairs Committee is paying American politicians to be pro-Israel. \n\nAIPAC! https://t.co/UdzaFUEfrh\n\u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) February 11, 2019\n\nThis is a sensitive subject for Jewish Americans with a wide range of views about Israel and US foreign policy, and by responding in this way to McCarthy\u2019s provocations, Omar essentially gave McCarthy the pretext he\u2019d previously lacked to analogize her to King. Omar\u2019s fellow first-term Democrat Rep. Max Rose (D-NY) swiftly slammed her remarks as \u201cdeeply hurtful to Jews,\u201d TPM\u2019s Josh Marshall deemed it a \u201cvery unfortunate tweet,\u201d and even Chelsea Clinton joined the pile-on, which prompted a whole other series of counterattacks. \n\nLest you think any of this is happening in good faith, recall that McCarthy himself in October was accusing three Jewish Democrats of trying to \u201cbuy\u201d the 2018 midterms. \n\nMajority Leader Kevin McCarthy posted this tweet AFTER a bomb was sent to Soros' house. Up until a couple of minutes ago it was pinned to the top of his profile. pic.twitter.com/FEeKoPolHL\n\u2014 Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) October 24, 2018\n\nNonetheless, whether or not one takes McCarthy\u2019s complaints seriously, he has correctly identified a potentially explosive issue that is very well-calibrated to the specific goal of getting Democrats to fight with each other about a topic most Americans probably don\u2019t care very much about. \n\nIt\u2019s only partially about the Benjamins\n\nThe notion that congressional support for Israel is literally all about the Benjamins is clearly false, and Omar could have saved herself some grief by acknowledging as much in response to Ungar-Sargon\u2019s initial inquiry. There are, pretty obviously, major questions of ethnic and religious identity in play \u2014 not just among American Jews but also with the incredible influence of Christian Zionism in American politics and, conversely, the not-coincidental reality that Omar and Tlaib, who are both Muslim, have strong feelings on this topic.\n\nThat said, while it\u2019s true that to suggest a cabal of Jewish moneymen control Congress from behind the scenes via their perfidious financial influence certainly does traffic in anti-Semitic stereotypes, it\u2019s also clearly true that pro-Israel forces\u2019 financial clout makes a difference in American politics. \n\nDon\u2019t take my word for it \u2014 ask AIPAC, which says that \u201cthe United States Congress has provided Israel with the strongest support of any institution in the world\u201d and tells its members that \u201cinvolvement in the political process is a tangible way of showing friends of Israel that you care about who serves in Congress.\u201d It also specifically defines this in terms of being sufficiently generous with your campaign contributions to qualify as a member of AIPAC\u2019s Congressional Club. \n\nBeyond its involvement in encouraging campaign contributions, AIPAC also spends a lot of money on lobbying. \n\nThe $3.5 million AIPAC spent lobbying in 2018 is trivial compared to what business groups spend (the National Association of Realtors took the cake with $543 million in spending and mostly lost the argument over the home mortgage tax deduction anyway), but very large relative to the world of foreign policy. The No. 2 foreign policy donor, UNICEF USA, spent just $744,000, and its activities are orthogonal to AIPAC\u2019s interests anyway. The next-largest group lobbying on Israel, J Street, which advocates a pro-Israel, pro-peace agenda, spent less than 10 percent of AIPAC\u2019s lobbying budget. It actually got outspent by a second, smaller hawkish Israel policy group, the Israeli-American Coalition for Action. \n\nLast but by no means least, AIPAC spends on less formal means of influence-peddling. \n\nTheir annual trips to Israel for members of Congress are perennially the most popular form of foreign congressional travel, in no small part because the accommodations are rather lavish. As Rachael Bade and Amanda Becker have reported, AIPAC spends around $10,000 per guest on business-class airfare and luxury accommodations. Members are allowed to bring spouses and other family guests on the trips, and members frequently go multiple times. Comparable junkets for journalists are also available.\n\nTo view this as the primary driver of a foreign policy relationship that has roots in Cold War strategy and substantial links to evangelical eschatology is mistaken. But there\u2019s also something a little willfully naive about the counter-assertion that money is irrelevant. Haim Saban, a major Democratic Party donor, for example, has in the past described himself as \u201ca one-issue guy, and my issue is Israel.\u201d That gives many rank-and-file Democrats who don\u2019t particularly care about foreign policy (a good description of most members of Congress) good reason to adopt a pro-Israel line and enjoy the benefits rather than rocking the boat. \n\nRepublicans want a wedge; Omar gave them a sledgehammer\n\nThe larger context for this controversy, however, is not the strength of the pro-Israel lobby but its weakness. The concurrent administrations of Obama in the United States and Netanyahu in Israel led to a serious deterioration of the relationship between Democrats and pro-Israel organizations. \n\nOn a policy level, that was largely about Iran, where Israel stridently opposed Obama\u2019s nuclear deal but congressional Democrats mostly chose partisanship and ideology over AIPAC\u2019s preferences. \n\nOn a political level, that was about Netanyahu\u2019s eagerness to break with precedent and allow Israel to be used as a partisan wedge issue \u2014 all but openly campaigning on behalf of Mitt Romney and John Boehner against Obama and congressional Democrats \u2014 even while aware that this risked a backlash from Democrats in Congress. \n\nIn the Trump era, the United States has tilted further than ever in a pro-Israel direction (moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem even without a diplomatic agreement with the Palestinians about the status of the city), while Democrats have grown stronger in their criticisms of anti-Iranian activities by Saudi Arabia and the UAE that Israel supports. \n\nBernie Sanders has played a leading role in much of this, continuing a trajectory of shattering taboos that he launched during his 2016 campaign.\n\nBut Sanders, who is Jewish, and whose policy team includes seasoned professionals with years of experience on the issue, manages to make his points in a thoughtful, politically effective way. Omar\u2019s social media strategy, by contrast, is a gift to congressional Republicans who are eager to promote Democratic infighting. And there is now infighting aplenty, with other Democrats rushing to distance themselves from Omar while more left-wing writers and activists emphasize their agreement with the basic point that pro-Israel money matters. \n\nNADLER: \u201cIt is deeply disappointing and disturbing to hear Representative Ilhan Omar\u2019s (MN) choice of words in her exchange with a journalist yesterday, wherein she appears to traffic in old anti-Semitic tropes about Jews and money.\"\n\u2014 Sam Stein (@samstein) February 11, 2019\n\nFor nearly two weeks, Rep. @IlhanMN has avoided meeting with me to discuss why anti-Semitic tropes like these are hurtful to so many Americans. There is absolutely no place for this rhetoric in Congress -- or anywhere. https://t.co/0arhEAVyXO\n\u2014 Rep Josh Gottheimer (@RepJoshG) February 11, 2019\n\naccurately describing how the Israel lobby works is not anti-semitism https://t.co/30M6rVmeJb\n\u2014 Ashley Feinberg (@ashleyfeinberg) February 11, 2019\n\nThe fundamental reality, however, is that this is an inherently difficult topic for Democrats. A large majority of Americans say they sympathize more with the Israeli side than the Palestinian side in the conflict, but rank-and-file Democrats are split roughly 50-50. \n\nThat means that in order to be effective, people who want to challenge the pro-Israel consensus in politics need to be careful and strategic with their interventions \u2014 the opposite of tossing off inflammatory tweets on a Sunday evening with no strategy lined up.
