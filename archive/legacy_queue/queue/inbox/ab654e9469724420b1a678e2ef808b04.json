      "Selection": "Plant-based meat products might fix our food system.\n \nBeyond Meat, the plant-based meat company, is going public next week.\n\nThe company sells burgers that contain no meat, but taste like they do. Its stated goal is to fix our food system. Its initial public offering (IPO) is the latest sign that alt-meat is going mainstream \u2014 and that\u2019s a big deal.\n\nIt\u2019s been a good few years for Beyond Meat. National chains including Del Taco, Carl\u2019s Jr., and T.G.I. Friday\u2019s have started carrying their products. They\u2019ve also found their way onto grocery store shelves at Whole Foods, Kroger, and Target. In total, Beyond Meat says its products are available in more than 35,000 outlets, from hotels and college campuses to grocery stores and sports stadiums. Sales have been growing fast \u2014 last year the company reported revenues of $87.9 million, up from $32.6 million in 2017.\n\nNow, the company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO, scheduled for next week. They\u2019ll sell shares in the company for between $19 and $21 per share, allowing them to raise $183 million for additional manufacturing facilities, research and development, and sales. If their stock sells at the high end of that, the company would be valued at $1.2 billion. They\u2019ll be listed on NASDAQ as BYND.\n\nFounded in 2009 by CEO Ethan Brown, the Los Angeles-based company\u2019s products first hit supermarket shelves in 2013. Its rapid rise \u2014 food is not an easy industry to break into \u2014 reflects intense consumer demand and investor interest in meat alternatives. The company has never been profitable, and lost $29 million in 2018, but its rapidly growing revenues made it a good bet to many investors \u2014 as did its positioning on the frontier of a transformation of our food system.\n\n\u201cBeyond Meat was the first company to really set its sights on creating meat from plants that could compete on the basis of the things that meat eaters like about meat,\u201d Bruce Friedrich of the Good Food Institute, which works on policy and investment surrounding meat alternatives, told me. \u201cBefore Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, there was really this sense that plant-based foods was for vegetarians. People like Ethan Brown said, \u2018No, we can make plant-based foods that meat eaters like just as much.\u2019\u201d \n\nBrown will soon have a billion-dollar company to prove it. And while it\u2019s the first plant-based meat company to go public, it looks likely that it won\u2019t be the last. The trend that brought Beyond Meat racing to its billion-dollar valuation and IPO are just getting started \u2014 and that has the potential to be game-changing, not just for the industry, but for the world.\n\nPlant-based meat alternatives are getting big\n\nThere\u2019s a lot wrong with our food system. Producing meat by raising animals on factory farms produces tons of greenhouse gases, and many analysts think we can\u2019t tackle climate change without tackling the enormous emissions that go into agriculture. Animals in close quarters are fed low-dose antibiotics constantly so they don\u2019t make one another sick, which contributes to antibiotic resistance, a huge threat on the horizon for public health. And animals on factory farms are routinely subjected to intense cruelty and conditions that disgust the average American consumer.\n\nThat\u2019s what inspired people to start working on meat alternatives \u2014 and it may be what\u2019s inspiring the consumer enthusiasm that has buoyed them in recent years. Products like veggie burgers, fake chicken, and soy and almond milk are growing in popularity and market share \u2014 and even better, they\u2019re getting tastier and harder to distinguish from animal products. \n\nNew breakthroughs in food science have made it easier to imitate the flavor and texture of real meat. While early veggie burgers were almost exclusively purchased by vegetarians, Brown says that 93 percent of Beyond Meat customers buy regular meat too \u2014 suggesting the company has succeeded at making something that appeals to meat eaters. \n\nBeyond Meat was among the pioneers of this new generation of plant-based meat, which aimed to replace bean-based veggie burgers marketed mostly to vegans. Now, they\u2019ll be the first plant-based meat company to have an IPO. It\u2019s a remarkable success for the company. It\u2019s also remarkable because food companies rarely go public, Friedrich told me: \u201cThe food industry is highly centralized, and most exits are mergers or acquisitions by large food conglomerates.\u201d \n\nLast year, there were rumors that industry giant (and Beyond Meat investor) Tyson Foods was considering buying the company. Beyond Meat stayed independent, though. A few months later, the company added the chief financial officers of Coca-Cola and of Twitter to their board, signaling that it was getting the expertise on-board that it needed to become a huge public company.\n\nThe rest of the plant-based meat industry has been thriving too. Qdoba announced last week that it would be serving Beyond Meat competitor Impossible Foods. Earlier in April, Burger King launched the Impossible Whopper. Industry giants Tyson and Purdue are pursuing their own plant-based product lines. A few years ago, the Impossible Burger was available in a handful of restaurants \u2014 now it can be found in more than 5,000.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that there\u2019s a movement going on that\u2019s much bigger than any one company,\u201d Brown told Vox two weeks ago. \n\nThe interesting thing about that movement is that plant-based meats don\u2019t have to displace all animal meats in order to make a big difference. Every burger replaced with a Beyond Burger has an impact on CO2 emissions, demand for factory farming, and demand for antibiotics. The more the plant-based meat industry grows, the more those impacts will be visible \u2014 and that might, in turn, itself fuel more interest in plant-based meats. Beyond Burger\u2019s team doesn\u2019t just believe they\u2019ve found a niche \u2014 they say they\u2019ve figured out the \u201cFuture of Protein.\u201d Here\u2019s hoping they\u2019re right.\n\nSign up for the Future Perfect newsletter.
