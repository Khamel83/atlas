      "Title": "Donald Trump\u2019s closing argument if I lose, this was all a \u201cwaste of time\u201d Vox - All",
      "Selection": "Donald Trump has made his closing argument: If he doesn\u2019t get elected president, it will be the \u201csingle greatest waste of time,\u201d the Republican nominee told a crowd at a campaign rally Monday afternoon in an effort to get out the vote.\n\nIt might seem like an odd counter to his campaign\u2019s insistence that Trump\u2019s nomination has started a movement in the United States \u2014 one that cannot be silenced \u2014 but Trump isn\u2019t changing his underlying message. According to him, he is the only person who knows what is wrong with America, and he alone can fix it.\n\n\u201cGo vote because believe me, if we don\u2019t win, all of us, honestly, we\u2019ve all wasted our time,\u201d he said at the rally. \u201cThey may say good things about us as a movement. It won\u2019t mean a damn thing.\u201d\n\nPrivately, Trump seems to have accepted a potential loss. Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told New York magazine\u2019s Gabe Sherman that Trump privately told her that if he loses, \u201cthat\u2019s okay too.\u201d She responded that he had a responsibility to the movement he started.\n\nTrump\u2019s public claim that the election would be a \u201cwaste,\u201d though, is among some of the most fitting articulations of the worldview he\u2019s built over the years: Politics, as in life, is a zero-sum game. In Trump\u2019s world, you either get everything you want or the most disastrous deal in history.\n\n\u201cFor Donald Trump, calling someone a loser is not merely an insult, and calling someone a winner is not merely a compliment,\u201d my colleague Dylan Matthews wrote after Vox\u2019s staff reviewed 12 of Trump\u2019s books. \u201cHe\u2019s always believed in the fundamental zero-sum nature of the world. Whether he\u2019s discussing real estate in New York, or his \u201900s reality TV career, or his views on immigration and trade, he consistently views life as a succession of deals. Those deals are best thought of as fights over who gets what share of a fixed pot of resources. The idea of collaborating for mutual benefit rarely arises. Life is dealmaking, and dealmaking is about crushing your enemies.\u201d\n\nLosing to Hillary Clinton is no different \u2014 it\u2019s losing, and it\u2019s about him.\n",
