      "Title": "When Working From Home Doesn\u2019t Work The Atlantic - Business",
      "Selection": "In 1979, IBM was putting its stamp on the American landscape. For 20 years, it had been hiring the greats of modernism to erect buildings where scientists and salespeople could work shoulder-to-shoulder commanding the burgeoning computer industry. But that year, one of its new facilities\u2014the Santa Teresa Laboratory, in Silicon Valley\u2014tried an experiment. To ease a logjam at the office mainframe, it installed boxy, green-screened terminals in the homes of five employees, allowing them to work from home.\n\nThe idea of telecommuting was still a novelty. But this little solution seemed effective. By 1983, about 2,000 IBMers were working remotely. The corporation eventually realized that it could save millions by selling its signature buildings and institutionalizing distance work; the number of remote workers ballooned. In 2009, an IBM report boasted that \u201c40 percent of IBM\u2019s some 386,000 employees in 173 countries have no office at all.\u201d More than 58 million square feet of office space had been unloaded, at a gain of nearly $2 billion. IBM, moreover, wanted to help other corporations reap the same officeless efficiencies through its consulting services. Leading by example was good marketing.\n\nThen, in March of this year, came a startling announcement: IBM wanted thousands of its workers back in actual, physical offices again.\n\nThe reaction was generally unsparing. The announcement was depicted, variously, as the desperate move of a company whose revenues had fallen 20 quarters in a row; a veiled method of shedding workers; or an attempt to imitate companies, like Apple and Google, that never embraced remote work in the first place. \u201cIf what they\u2019re looking to do is reduce productivity, lose talent, and increase cost, maybe they\u2019re on to something,\u201d says Kate Lister, the president of Global Workplace Analytics, which measures (and champions) working from home.\n\nIBM might have seen this coming. A similarly censorious reaction greeted Yahoo when it reversed its work-from-home policy in 2013. Aetna and Best Buy have taken heat for like-minded moves since. That IBM called back its employees anyway is telling, especially given its history as \u201ca business whose business was how other businesses do business.\u201d Perhaps Big Blue\u2019s decision will prove to be a mere stumble in the long, inevitable march toward remote work for all. But there\u2019s reason to regard the move as a signal, however faint, that telecommuting has reached its high-water mark\u2014and that more is lost in working apart than was first apparent.\n\nHow could this be? According to Gallup, 43 percent of U.S. employees work remotely all or some of the time. As I look to my left, and then to my right, I see two other business-casual-clad men hammering away on their laptops beside me at a Starbucks just outside Chicago. They look productive. Studies back this impression up. Letting Chinese call-center employees work from home boosted their productivity by 13 percent, a Stanford study reported. And, again according to Gallup, remote workers log significantly longer hours than their office-bound counterparts.\n\nAnother batch of studies, however, shows the exact opposite: that proximity boosts productivity. (Don\u2019t send call-center workers home, one such study argues\u2014encourage them to spend more time together in the break room, where they can swap tricks of the trade.) Trying to determine which set of studies to trust is\u2014trust me\u2014a futile exercise. The data tend to talk past each other. But the research starts to make a little more sense if you ask what type of productivity we are talking about.\n\nIf it\u2019s personal productivity\u2014how many sales you close or customer complaints you handle\u2014then the research, on balance, suggests that it\u2019s probably better to let people work where and when they want. For jobs that mainly require interactions with clients (consultant, insurance salesman) or don\u2019t require much interaction at all (columnist), the office has little to offer besides interruption.\n\nBut other types of work hinge on what might be called \u201ccollaborative efficiency\u201d\u2014the speed at which a group successfully solves a problem. And distance seems to drag collaborative efficiency down. Why? The short answer is that collaboration requires communication. And the communications technology offering the fastest, cheapest, and highest-bandwidth connection is\u2014for the moment, anyway\u2014still the office.\n\nConsider the extremely tiny office that is the cockpit of a Boeing 727. Three crew members are stuffed in there, wrapped in instrument panels. Comfort-wise, it\u2019s not a great setup. But the forced proximity benefits crew communication, as researchers from UC San Diego and UC Irvine demonstrated in an analysis of one simulated flight\u2014specifically the moments after one crew member diagnoses a fuel leak.\n\nA transcript of the cockpit audio doesn\u2019t reveal much communication at all. The flight engineer reports a \u201cfunny situation.\u201d The pilot says \u201cHmmm.\u201d The co-pilot says \u201cOhhhh.\u201d\n\nMatch the audio with a video of the cockpit exchange and it\u2019s clear that the pilots don\u2019t need to say much to reach a shared understanding of the problem. That it\u2019s a critical situation is underscored by body language: The flight engineer turns his body to face the others. That the fuel is very low is conveyed by jabbing his index finger at the fuel gauge. And a narrative of the steps he has already taken\u2014no, the needle on the gauge isn\u2019t stuck, and yes, he has already diverted fuel from engine one, to no avail\u2014is enacted through a quick series of gestures at the instrument panel and punctuated by a few short utterances.\n\nIt is a model of collaborative efficiency, taking just 24 seconds. In the email world, the same exchange could easily involve several dozen messages\u2014which, given the rapidly emptying fuel tank, is not ideal.\n\nThis brings us to a point about electronic communications technologies. Notionally, they are cheap and instantaneous, but in terms of person-hours spent using them, they are actually expensive and slow. Email, where everything must literally be spelled out, is probably the worst. The telephone is better. Videoconferencing, which gives you not just inflection but expression, is better still. More-recent tools like the workplace-communication app Slack integrate social cues into written exchanges, leveraging the immediacy of instant-messaging and the informality of emoji, plus the ability to create a channel to bond over last night\u2019s #gameofthrones.\n\nYet all of these technologies have a weakness, which is that we have to choose to use them. And this is where human nature throws a wrench into things. Back in 1977, the MIT professor Thomas J. Allen looked at communication patterns among scientists and engineers and found that the farther apart their desks were, the less likely they were to communicate. At the 30-meter mark, the likelihood of regular communication approached zero.\n\nThe expectation was that information technology would flatten the so-called Allen Curve. But Ben Waber, a visiting scientist at MIT, recently found that it hasn\u2019t. The communications tools that were supposed to erase distance, it turns out, are used largely among people who see one another face-to-face. In one study of software developers, Waber, working alongside researchers from IBM, found that workers in the same office traded an average of 38 communications about each potential trouble spot they confronted, versus roughly eight communications between workers in different locations.\n\nThe power of presence has no simple explanation. It might be a manifestation of the \u201cmere-exposure effect\u201d: We tend to gravitate toward what\u2019s familiar; we like people whose faces we see, even just in passing. Or maybe it\u2019s the specific geometry of such encounters. The cost of getting someone\u2019s attention at the coffee machine is low\u2014you know they\u2019re available, because they\u2019re getting coffee\u2014and if, mid-conversation, you see that the other person has no idea what you\u2019re talking about, you automatically adjust.\n\nWhatever the mechanisms at play, they were successfully distilled into what Judith Olson, a distance-work expert at UC Irvine, calls \u201cradical collocation.\u201d In the late 1990s, Ford Motor let Olson put six teams of six to eight employees into experimental war rooms arranged to maximize team members\u2019 peripheral awareness of what the others were up to. The results were striking: The teams completed their software-development projects in about a third of the time it usually took Ford engineers to complete similar projects. That extreme model is hard to replicate, Olson cautions. It requires everyone to be working on a single project at the same time, which organizational life rarely allows.\n\nBut IBM has clearly absorbed some of these lessons in planning its new workspaces, which many of its approximately 5,000 no-longer-remote workers will inhabit. \u201cIt used to be we\u2019d create a shared understanding by sending documents back and forth. It takes forever. They could be hundreds of pages long,\u201d says Rob Purdie, who trains fellow IBMers in Agile, an approach to software development that the company has adopted and is applying to other business functions, like marketing. \u201cNow we ask: \u2018How do we use our physical space to get on and stay on the same page?\u2019\u2009\u201d\n\nThe answer, of course, depends on the nature of the project at hand. But it usually involves a central table, a team of no more than nine people, an outer rim of whiteboards, and an insistence on lightweight forms of communication. If something must be written down, a Post\u2011it Note is ideal. It can be stuck on a whiteboard and arranged to form a \u201cBVC\u201d\u2014big, visual chart\u2014that lets everyone see the team\u2019s present situation, much like the 727\u2019s instrument panels. Communication is both minimized and maximized.\n\nTalking with Purdie, I began to wonder whether the company was calling its employees back to an old way of working or to a new one\u2014one that didn\u2019t exist in 1979, when business moved at a more stately pace. In those days, IBM could decide what to build, plan how to build it, and count on its customers to accept what it finally built at the end of a months-long process. Today, in the age of the never-ending software update, business is more like a series of emergencies that need to be approached like an airplane\u2019s fuel leak. You diagnose a problem, deliver a quick-and-dirty solution, get feedback, course-correct, and repeat, always with an eye on the changing weather outside.\n\nI asked Purdie whether IBM\u2019s new approach could be accomplished at a distance, using all the new collaborative technology out there. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, it can. But the research says those teams won\u2019t be as productive. You won\u2019t fly.\u201d\n",
