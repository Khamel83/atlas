      "Selection": "The 50th season of Sesame Street kicked off yesterday (Nov. 9) with a new message for kids: Failure isn\u2019t always a bad thing.\n\nThis season, the popular cast of muppets will focus on the role that making mistakes can play in building young children\u2019s resilience. Entitled \u201cOops and Aha!: Embracing the Power of Possibilities,\u201d this theme is especially relevant in the US, where preschool-aged children are increasingly pressured to meet \u201cschool readiness\u201d standards and where pediatricians have to prescribe play time to over-scheduled kids.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s preschool kids are under an unprecedented amount of stress and pressure to meet certain academic and social-emotional benchmarks, often before they\u2019re developmentally ready,\u201d Rosemarie Truglio, Sesame Workshop\u2019s senior vice president for curriculum and content, said in a release. \u201cThat result-oriented mindset can make kids afraid to take even the safest risks\u2014never trying to pour their own milk for fear of spilling it.\u201d\n\nYUCK I hate celebrations. Have a rotten 50th birthday Sesame Street\u2026 #Sesame50\n\n\u2014 Oscar the Grouch (@OscarTheGrouch) November 10, 2019\n\nBetween birth and age school age, children\u2019s brains develop quickly, and science shows play can help them learn to focus attention, communicate, problem-solve, and work with others. Sesame Street has long touted the benefits of play and pressure-free learning environments for kids. But in a world where hyper-competitive education systems can sometimes determine a child\u2019s future before they are even born, that message is all the more important.\n\nThe show\u2019s 50th season will focus on the role that caregivers can play in allowing\u2014and even at times encouraging\u2014kids to make mistakes and learn to bounce back from them. According to Sesame Workshop, one episode will feature 3-year-old muppet Rudy Cadabby getting upset when he \u201cruins\u201d a drawing. Alan Muraoka, the current owner of Hooper\u2019s Store, then encourages Rudy to keep trying, and Rudy eventually makes a new drawing inspired by his mistake.\n\nThe goal is to model important values like confidence, perseverance, and resilience\u2014values that researchers say today\u2019s preschoolers are lacking.\n",
