      "Selection": "Rep. Lauren Boebert speaks during a press conference at the US Capitol in June. | Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nInaction normalizes anti-Muslim rhetoric and sentiment.\n\nCongressional leaders are struggling to respond to anti-Muslim comments made by Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), an uncomfortable reminder of how accepted Islamophobia has become among Republican lawmakers, who\u2019ve broadly been silent in the wake of these statements.\n\nTwo weeks ago during a floor speech, Boebert referred to Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), one of three Muslim House lawmakers and the only one to wear a hijab, as a member of the \u201cjihad squad.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Jihad Squad member from Minnesota has paid her husband, and not her brother husband, the other one, over a million dollars in campaign funds,\u201d she said in her remarks.\n\nOver the Thanksgiving recess, Boebert again made anti-Muslim remarks in a speech, claiming that once while riding an elevator Omar was on, she saw a worried Capitol Police officer approaching. In her comments at the November event, Boebert said they had nothing to fear from the Democrat because she wasn\u2019t wearing a backpack, insinuating that Omar could have been a suicide bomber.\n\nThis week, it was reported that Boebert has told this story in public more than once. (Omar has said she never witnessed Boebert have this exchange with an officer.)\n\nFact, this buffoon looks down when she sees me at the Capitol, this whole story is made up. Sad she thinks bigotry gets her clout.\n\nAnti-Muslim bigotry isn\u2019t funny & shouldn\u2019t be normalized. Congress can\u2019t be a place where hateful and dangerous Muslims tropes get no condemnation. https://t.co/S1APT7RbqW\n\n\u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) November 26, 2021\n\nBoebert later apologized to \u201canyone in the Muslim community I offended with my comment,\u201d but has yet to publicly apologize to Omar, and went on to accuse Omar of anti-American rhetoric in a phone call the two had earlier this week, according to a statement she later made.\n\nBoebert\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThus far, Republican leadership has been quiet on the matter, issuing no public condemnation of Boebert\u2019s comments. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Friday that Boebert had already apologized for her comments and reached out to Omar, even though the call they had didn\u2019t have a resolution. \u201cThis party is for anyone and everyone who craves freedom and supports religious liberty,\u201d McCarthy said of the GOP.\n\nHouse Democratic leaders, meanwhile, have condemned Boebert\u2019s Islamophobic remarks but have yet to put forth a formal resolution or penalty regarding her statements. Beyond a statement condemning Boebert, Democrats and Republicans have a couple of options for punishment, including a resolution denouncing these comments, a formal reprimand or censure, or the stripping of committee assignments. At this point, neither party has publicly announced further action they would take.\n\nPressure for a more serious punishment is building: On Thursday, five Democratic House caucus chairs called for Boebert to be stripped of her committee assignments, much like Reps. Paul Gosar and Marjorie Taylor Greene were in the wake of posts they made seeming to promote political violence. The caucus chairs argue that inaction in the face of Boebert\u2019s comments effectively condones Islamophobia and sends a message about what types of extremist comments Congress is willing to accept.\n\n\u201cThere must be consequences for elected representatives who traffic in anti-Muslim and racist tropes that make all Muslims across the country less safe,\u201d the lawmakers write.\n\nResearchers have indeed found that Islamophobic rhetoric by politicians has real-world consequences and has been directly linked with hate speech targeted toward Muslim Americans. If Congress doesn\u2019t impose more penalties regarding this incident, lawmakers could \u2014 whether they mean to or not \u2014 further normalize anti-Muslim rhetoric and sentiment, affecting not only Muslim lawmakers but millions of Muslim Americans as well.\n\nIn their lack of response, Republicans, in particular, have shown that their party isn\u2019t willing to denounce such Islamophobic statements. And this creates the appearance that the party is open to embracing the hateful rhetoric that former President Donald Trump and others have used.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that Islamophobia pervades our culture, our politics, and even policy decisions,\u201d Omar said at a press conference on Wednesday. \u201cThe most pervasive is the constant suggestion that all Muslims are terrorists and should be feared. So when a sitting member of Congress calls a colleague a member of the \u2018jihad squad\u2019 and falsifies a story to suggest that I will blow up the Capitol, it is not just an attack on me, but on millions of American Muslims across this country.\u201d\n\n Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) speaks at a news conference about Islamophobia on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, November 30.\n\nHow Congress acts in response to this incident \u2014 and others like it \u2014 sets a tone that extends far beyond its halls.\n\nCongressional inaction condones Islamophobia\n\nCongressional inaction toward Boebert\u2019s comments only helps normalize them, and the fact that Boebert hasn\u2019t faced more immediate consequences from either party makes it seem as though expressions of anti-Muslim sentiment are acceptable to both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 outright condemnation was important, but the delay in additional disciplinary action has been surprising to Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).\n\n\u201cI believe that so far the response from the Democratic leadership is weak and late and doesn\u2019t meet the seriousness of these attacks,\u201d Awad told Vox. \u201cIslamophobia has unfortunately become a reality of our life as American Muslims. It has not been tackled with the vigor and the swiftness it needs to be dealt with.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican response to Boebert\u2019s comments further reaffirms leadership\u2019s seeming willingness to accept or look past the bigotry and rhetoric of its members.\n\nThe decision to stay silent on this front follows Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s treatment of a video posted by Gosar that depicted him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and drawing weapons against President Joe Biden. At the time, McCarthy did not publicly condemn Gosar. As the Washington Post reported on Thursday, Republican leadership has sought to address internal conflicts, but focused less on the issue of Islamophobia.\n\nMcCarthy has spoken out about other discriminatory statements caucus members have made in the past. Though he did not do so immediately after they came to light, he did publicly denounce several anti-Semitic and violent statements Greene had made. More recently, McCarthy responded to her comments comparing being required to wear masks to the Holocaust by saying, \u201cMarjorie is wrong, and her intentional decision to compare the horrors of the Holocaust with wearing masks is appalling.\u201d\n\nAs the Post notes, however, his approach to colleagues making extremist comments seems to have shifted since his statements about Greene in May, with some speculating that he\u2019s now focused on building support for winning the House speakership \u2014 and keeping the base satisfied to do so.\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s approach, when it comes to Boebert\u2019s remarks, has been indicative of many rank-and-file Republicans\u2019 reactions to her statements as well. While Reps. Nancy Mace (R-SC) and Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) are among those who have spoken out and criticized Boebert\u2019s comments, many others in the caucus have shied away from confronting them directly. Greene, meanwhile, echoed Boebert\u2019s \u201cjihad squad\u201d rhetoric in her own tweet this week.\n\nIt\u2019s another sign that many Republicans are willing to stay quiet when it comes to criticizing bigotry and extremism by their members, putting Democrats in a position where they have to be the ones to act. Republicans have been quick to decry certain forms of bigotry they have said they\u2019ve seen in the Democratic caucus, for instance attempting to censure progressive lawmakers \u2014 including Omar \u2014 for criticisms of Israel that some perceived as anti-Semitic. Democrats have also criticized Omar for similar reasons.\n\n\u201cRepublicans have long been critical of Omar for her criticisms of Israel, and members of both parties have denounced some of her statements as antisemitic,\u201d the Washington Post\u2019s Jacqueline Alemany and Marianna Sotomayor write. \u201cIn 2019, House Democratic leaders swiftly condemned Omar\u2019s suggestion that Israel\u2019s allies in American politics were motivated by money rather than principle. Omar apologized later that day.\u201d\n\nCongress is known for moving slowly in general, though the response to the Boebert comments has taken a while. Democrats responded after a week and a half regarding the video Gosar posted depicting violence toward Ocasio-Cortez. Gosar had posted that video around November 7 and was censured by the House on November 17. Boebert first made her floor speech using the term \u201cjihad squad\u201d on November 17 and then used the term at another event, video of which was posted on November 25.\n\nDemocrats have argued that there could be downsides to punishing Boebert; they worry that doing so could further raise her profile and boost her ability to fundraise from conservative voters. Greene brought in more than $3 million in fundraising in the first quarter of this year after her committee assignments were stripped. Some Democrats have also said they don\u2019t want to be in a position of constantly disciplining Republicans who make extremist and racist statements, according to Politico.\n\nStill, as was evident in the punishments levied on Gosar and Greene, Democrats act when they feel it is necessary. As the Hill reported, Democrats considered a resolution to condemn Islamophobia earlier this week but were focused on putting pressure on House Republicans to act. In an MSNBC interview Thursday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Democrats were still discussing what the \u201cappropriate action\u201d is.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an option to ignore it because it might help her raise money,\u201d Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) stressed at a press conference earlier this week. Punishment \u201csends a message to the rest of our colleagues that this is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nPolitical statements can be tied to real-life violence\n\nIn the wake of Boebert\u2019s latest statements, Omar has been the target of anti-Muslim vitriol and death threats, an apparent consequence of the recent Islamophobic remarks. Researchers have found that the rhetoric used by public officials could have an impact on the rise of anti-Muslim rhetoric and violence \u2014 a major reason it\u2019s important for House leadership to push back against it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a through line between what is said about me ... what my colleagues have said ... and the death threats I receive,\u201d Omar said this week.\n\nAt the Wednesday press conference, Omar played one of the threatening voicemails \u2014 a message filled with racist and Islamophobic slurs \u2014 she\u2019s received following her call with Boebert. Omar and other progressive women of color including Reps. Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib have long faced numerous death threats since they\u2019ve been elected.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) plays a horrific death threat she received following Rep. Lauren Boebert\u2019s (R-CO) recent Islamophobic attacks on her.\n\nWarning: It's incredibly graphic. pic.twitter.com/5PGODcaJOu\n\n\u2014 The Recount (@therecount) November 30, 2021\n\nThere have also been several recent examples of political speech being tied to actual violence. Participants in the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol have referenced comments by Trump and said he instructed them to go to the building. Trump had called on a crowd to \u201cfight like hell\u201d prior to the storming of the Capitol, telling attendees \u201cwe are going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue ... and we are going to the Capitol.\u201d\n\nResearch has indicated that anti-Muslim rhetoric can be linked to hate crimes, based on the limited data that law enforcement sources currently have. A 2016 study from California State University San Bernardino, for example, found an 87.5 percent increase in hate crimes toward Muslim Americans after Trump called for a ban on Muslim people entering the country.\n\nSince the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Awad notes that anti-Muslim rhetoric has been normalized by many politicians, who\u2019ve leveraged Islamophobia to energize members of their base. A 2021 CAIR survey found that 69 percent of Muslim Americans said they\u2019d experienced an instance of anti-Muslim bigotry since the 9/11 attacks, and 95 percent said they\u2019d speak out if they heard negative comments about Muslims and Islam.\n\n\u201cWe have been fighting \u2014 as an institution and as a community \u2014 Islamophobia for the past 20 years,\u201d Awad said. \u201cOver the years, it\u2019s been elevated, normalized, and legislated. We have the most influential people in our lives trafficking in Islamophobia believing that it will get them somewhere with their base.\u201d\n\nTlaib echoed this point this week, emphasizing the effect Congress\u2019s actions in this case could have.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also here today in support of the 3.45 million Muslim neighbors in our country, because it\u2019s also their lives that are put in grave danger when people like Rep. Boebert are allowed to use their national platform and elected office to spread hate and dangerous racist rhetoric that enables violence toward Muslims,\u201d Tlaib said.\n\nLawmakers would be making a mistake if they weigh nullifying the political benefits Boebert could extract from any punishment more heavily than making a decisive statement against Islamophobia.\n",
