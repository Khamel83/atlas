Follow The Points Guy on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0Twitter, and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @tpg_alerts.\n\nAirfare deals are typically\u00a0only\u00a0available on limited dates. We recommend you use\u00a0Google Flights\u00a0to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia, which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you\u2019re using the\u00a0American Express Platinum Card, you\u2019ll need to\u00a0book directly with the airline or through Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points. Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of\u00a0Orbitz\u00a0or\u00a0Expedia\u2019s courtesy cancellation if you\u2019re unable to get the time away from work or family.\n\nHere\u2019s a deal we don\u2019t see every day. Several carriers are offering great fares on flights to Cairo, Egypt (CAI). Fly from either New York (JFK) or Chicago (ORD) to the Egyptian capital from just $550 round-trip on Air France. New York-based flyers have a choice between Egyptair\u2019s nonstop flight from JFK to CAI, or can fly via Paris (CDG) on Air France for a few dollars less. If you\u2019re based in Chicago (ORD), you\u2019ll find the low fares on Etihad, so you\u2019ll have to connect in Abu Dhabi (AUH). These prices are generally available from November 2017 all the way through May of 2018, but exact availability depends on where you\u2019re originating from. Use Google Flights to find dates that work for you, and then either book through the airlines directly or through an OTA like Expedia or Orbitz.\n\nLunch with a view or two  Day 1 in Cairo was a blast. It\u2019s hot, but not THAT bad and there were virtually no tourists- my favorite way to see the sights! And never for a split second did I feel unsafe. Just like the stock market buy low/sell high \u2013 when a destination\u2019s tourism is way down it can be the best time to go (like that time I went to Tokyo after the nuclear incident and I was virtually the only tourist in the Tsukiji Fish market).\n\nA post shared by Brian Kelly (@thepointsguy) on Aug 15, 2017 at 2:49pm PDT\n\nAirlines:\u00a0Air France, Egyptair, EtihadRoutes: JFK/ORD to CAICost:\u00a0$550+ round-trip in economyDates:\u00a0November 2017 \u2013 May 2018Booking Link:\u00a0Orbitz\u00a0or\u00a0ExpediaPay With:\u00a0The Platinum Card from American Express\u00a0(5x on airfare), Chase Sapphire Reserve,\u00a0Premier Rewards Gold Card from American Express,\u00a0Citi Prestige\u00a0(3x on airfare) or\u00a0Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00a0(2x on travel)\n\nHere are a few examples of what you can book:\n\nNew York (JFK) to Cairo (CAI) for $550 round-trip on Air France:\n\nChicago (ORD) to Cairo (CAI) for $608 round-trip on Etihad:\n\nNew York (JFK) to Cairo (CAI) for $635 round-trip on Egyptair:\n\nMaximize Your Purchase\n\nDon\u2019t forget to use a credit card that earns additional points on airfare purchases, such as the\u00a0American Express Platinum Card\u00a0(5x on flights booked directly with airlines or American Express Travel),\u00a0Chase Sapphire Reserve,\u00a0American Express Premier Rewards Gold\u00a0or\u00a0Citi Prestige\u00a0(3x on airfare) or the\u00a0Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00a0(2x on all travel purchases).
