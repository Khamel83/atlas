      "Selection": "You never have to worry about broken gravy again. Or lumpy gravy or wan, watery gravy. Frankly, you don\u2019t have to worry about serving any bland, textureless, or colorless meal ever again, either. Because at virtually all times, Cal Peternell\u2019s 4-ingredient marvel sauce will be within reach.\n\nUnlike other herby sauces you\u2019ve known\u2014pestos and pistous and anchovy-leaning salsa verdes\u2014this one trades in a few of its auxiliary ingredients for one clever, clarifying step.\n\nPeternell takes the rougher of winter herbs\u2014prickly rosemary and furry-skinned sage, who aren\u2019t usually at home in a raw sauce\u2014and fries them crisp. As he explains, \u201cFrying herb leaves before mixing them in allows them to be their whole spiky selves, adding a polite thorniness, giving sweet parsley a kind, crunchy kick.\u201d\n\nHis manner of doing so has all sorts of advantages over what you might think when you\u2019re told: \u201cfry\u201d\u2014in his way, you\u2019ll pour only a shallow pool of oil 3/4-inch deep, rather than a whole pot. You won\u2019t need to rig a thermometer, and you can just use your regular olive oil if you like. And it will all happen fast, engaging all senses as the oil burbles and blooms, the leaves buckle, and your house starts to smell like you\u2019ve just rotisseried a Christmas tree.\n\n\u201cFrying herb leaves before mixing them in allows them to be their whole spiky selves, adding a polite thorniness, giving sweet parsley a kind, crunchy kick.\u201d\n\u2014Cal Peternell\n\nThis move is a great trick for adding crunch, intrigue, and a gentle woodsy perfume to fresh pastas and roast meats and you-name-its (and will make you look quite fancy in the process), but here you\u2019ll crumble the leaves straight into a slurry of chopped parsley, garlic, and more olive oil.\n\nNot only do you likely already have all these ingredients laying around, but you probably needed to use that half-bunch of rosemary or wilting sage up quick. They\u2019ll live a longer life this way, adding electric color and crunch beyond their prime to whatever you might want to spoon the sauce over.\n\nThe uses and variations are almost literally endless. Grilled steaks, pots of beans, bowls of ricotta, fistfuls of bread. \u201cThe day after Thanksgiving,\" Peternell wrote to me, \"I like to poach an egg, set it in a hot spoonful of leftover buttercup squash, and eat it with fried herb salsa. If last night's fog is still hanging dark, I might stir something spicy, crushed chilis or harissa, into the salsa to brighten things up.\u201d\n\nAnd of course the turkey\u2019s a good candidate, whether the gravy makes it to the table or not.\n\nCal Peternell\u2019s Fried Herb Salsa\n\nGenius Recipes\n\nMakes\u00a01 cup\n\nFried Herb Salsa\n\n1\n\ngarlic clove, pounded to a paste with a pinch of salt\n\n1//3\n\ncups finely chopped parsley\n\n1/3\n\ncup good olive oil\n\n1/3\n\ncup crumbled fried herbs (recipe follows)\n\nFried Herbs\n\nCooking oil, vegetable or olive\n\nLeaves from 1 bunch rosemary, sage, or savory (or a mixture), patted dry if necessary to avoid spits and splatters\n\nSalt\n\nPhotos by Bobbi Lin\n\nGot a genius recipe to share\u2014from a classic cookbook, an online source, or anywhere, really?
