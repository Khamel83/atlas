      "Title": "Now the 100 individual privacy settings you need to set on your phone can be done in a single app Quartz",
      "Selection": "When it comes to privacy controls, we may now have too much of a good thing. Smartphone owners must now make more than 100 privacy decisions about how how much data their apps can share on Apple\u2019s iOs and Google\u2019s Android operating systems. That number will only climb as privacy settings affect more of our devices and software.\n\nThe result is not more privacy. It\u2019s confusion. \u201cMost people although they care about privacy won\u2019t spend huge amounts of time playing with those settings,\u201d said computer science researcher Norman Sadeh at Carnegie Mellon University in an interview. \u201cDoing the right thing in this space means, in principle, giving more control to users but it becomes unmanageable and underused. We\u2019ve developed technology to assist users with these settings\u201d\n\nTired of waiting for the tech giants to fix the problem, Norman Sadeh\u2019s team at Carnegie Mellon University developed a personal privacy assistant app powered by machine learning. The app learns your preferences by asking a few key questions about privacy, and a machine learning algorithm uses this data to group users into distinct profiles. The app can then make recommendations and give users a single dashboard to manage their data and privacy settings.\n\nScreenshot from the privacy assistant app developed by Carnegie Mellon University .\nThe CMU team presented findings from a study with the app at the Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security in Denver this June. Users accepted 79% of the app\u2019s privacy settings recommendations significantly reducing the time users needed to select the desired privacy controls (about 20% of the settings were entered by users, and only 5% were changed from the app\u2019s recommendation). Participants were also generally permissive. Of the 3,559 app requests for data, users rejected only 19% in their privacy settings. The most likely to be rejected were requests for phone call histories (almost half), while camera access was most accepted (95% acceptance).\n\nThe key to solving the problem was obtaining accurate data on peoples\u2019 preferences. Earlier research has shown smartphone users are typically unaware of the data apps collect (and uncomfortable once they find out). Drawing assumptions from people\u2019s default settings for that reason doesn\u2019t work. Instead, Sadeh elicited people\u2019s preferences in an earlier study by creating \u201cprivacy nudges\u201d (short messages such as \u201cYour Location has been Shared 5,398 Times\u201c) to prompt them to re-evaluate their privacy settings. More than half added additional restrictions.\n\nEven though desire for privacy is strong, commercial demand is not. Privacy controls still rank as a \u201csecondary task\u201d for smartphone buyers, says Sadeh. People rarely spend much time or money on it. It needs to be easier for people to adopt it. The security-conscious Blackphone, marketed as \u201cNSA-proof\u201d by the Swiss privacy outfit Silent Circle and Spanish smartphone maker Geeksphone, only sold 6,000 units to distributors despite sales predictions of 250,000, reports The Guardian.\n\nThat makes privacy something that has to be solved by closing the distance between the users\u2019s desire to safeguard their data and the complexity of doing so today. By using machine learning to simplify personal privacy settings, Sadeh believes \u201cwe can help overcome this gap,\u201d he said.\n\nThe app will roll out on the Google Play store later this summer. At the moment, it\u2019s available only to users who have \u201croot access\u201d to their smartphone\u2019s Android operating system, the equivalent of a jailbroken iOS phone, so the app has access to phones\u2019 permissions. The team will release a workaround later in the year, although an iOS version is not expected immediately. Sadeh, who says Apple and Google have legitimate concerns about exposing those permissions, expects the operating systems will eventually allow secure access to the controls to manage privacy settings.\n\nMaybe people will start using them.\n",
