      "Selection": "College freshmen turn to empathic people during stressful times, research shows.\n\n\u201cThe transition to college can be tumultuous,\u201d says Jamil Zaki, an assistant professor of psychology at Stanford University and coauthor of the study. \u201cWhom you end up making friendships with can play a significant role in how you\u2019ll deal with the stress and hardship of freshman year.\u201d\n\nA 2008 poll conducted by the Associated Press and mtvU found that 40% of college students said they felt stress regularly\u2014and almost one in five seriously considered dropping out of school.\n\nWith those high stress levels in mind, the researchers, including Stanford economics professor Matthew Jackson and former Stanford doctoral candidate Desmond Ong, put nearly 200 Stanford freshmen\u2014who had recently moved into first-year dorms\u2014through a battery of personality tests and questionnaires. Students also answered questions related to social networks within their dorms, for example, \u201cWho usually makes you feel positive?\u201d or \u201cWho do you turn to when something bad happens?\u201d\n\nTheir goal was to determine which students occupied central roles in these different networks\u2014notably groups based on trust, fun, and excitement. The researchers found that individuals were more particular about whom they included in their trust networks compared to groups related to fun and excitement. In those selective trust networks, freshmen were more likely to include highly empathic students.\n\nIn contrast, when students wanted to feel positive and have fun, they were more likely to seek out dorm mates high in happiness. This suggests that students\u2019 personalities are related to the different roles that they play in supporting their communities.\n\n\u201cWhat we find here is not only that people\u2019s networks of fun-based friendships are denser than their more trust- and stress-based networks,\u201d Jackson says, \u201cbut also that more central people in a network have personalities that match the purpose of that network in intuitive ways. \u201d\n\nJust as you need the right outfit for a particular occasion, college freshmen need certain friends for certain situations.\n\nWhen you need a dose of fun, engaging with a positive and happy friend can lift your mood. But that friend may not be the best person to go to when you need someone to confide in. An empathic friend, on the other hand, may be just the right person for helping you through difficult and challenging times.\n\n\u201cEmpathic individuals were more likely to help their dorm mates and provide support during difficult times,\u201d says Sylvia Morelli, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago and lead author of the study. \u201cThese freshmen became magnets for close relationships in their new dorms.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmpathic people are the ears and shoulders of these communities,\u201d Zaki says.\n\nThis research shows that people know the difference between these two types of individuals. They spend time with individuals high in positive emotion, but target empathic individuals when they are stressed.\n\n\u201cThe study offers an opportunity for college students to examine their own relationships,\u201d says Morelli, a former postdoctoral fellow in Stanford\u2019s Social Neuroscience Lab, \u201cespecially against the landscape of social media where they can have seemingly countless \u2018friends\u2019 across the country and the world. Our work suggests that people will turn to only a small handful of these friends when things get stressful, and that they will trust their friends who show empathy and concern.\u201d\n\nAn additional coauthor of the study is Rucha Makati of the University of Illinois at Chicago.
