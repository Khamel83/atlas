      "Selection": "If you\u2019re a frequent TPG reader, your life has likely been affected by the coronavirus pandemic and its resulting impact on travel.\n\nNumerous TPG readers have told us that they booked nonrefundable reservations because they didn\u2019t plan to cancel their trip. Others purchased travel insurance, but most trip insurance doesn\u2019t cover epidemics so they\u2019re still out the money. In many such cases, your best bet is to reach out directly to the airline or hotel in question and ask for help.\n\nRelated: Will \u201ccancel for any reason\u201d insurance protect your trip?\n\nTPG has covered how to reach customer service as quickly as possible \u2014 but what should you ask for once you get on the phone?\n\nBe clear about what you need\n\nBefore you get on the phone, know where you want to go before you reach out to your airline to make any changes. A customer service representative can\u2019t tell you whether or not it\u2019s best for you to go home to your own apartment, or shelter in place at your parents\u2019 house in another state, and it isn\u2019t their job to wait on the line while you draft up a pros-and-cons checklist.\n\nRelated: A number of airlines have suspended all routes in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic\n\nHave your desired airport code, travel times and dates, your passport number and record locator, and any other personal information ready on hand before you reach out. And be prepared for long hold times, or try reaching out via Twitter or text.\n\nBe flexible on how you accomplish your goal\n\nIt\u2019s great to have a specific plan in place, but keep your big picture goal in mind. Right now, your top priority should be safety and speed, not necessarily convenience or efficiency. If you\u2019re trying to get home to Brooklyn or Queens, be willing to consider flying into Newark, Philly or even Boston. Similarly, flying into Oakland, San Jose or even Sacramento could be a good alternative to San Francisco if you need to get back to the Bay Area.\n\nAlternatively, consider renting a car and driving where you need to go if the journey isn\u2019t too long \u2014 or if you\u2019re up for taking the scenic route home. The main goal of social distancing is increasing the amount of physical distance between you and other people, and a road trip fulfills most of the criteria. Keep in mind that most hotels and stores along the way may be closed or operating under limited hours, so stock up on gas and supplies well before setting out.\u00a0\n\nNegotiation strategy: Big ask, little ask\n\nIf you know that you can\u2019t or won\u2019t need to travel any longer, you\u2019ll probably want your money (or points) back instead of rescheduling your trip for a later date. But just because your friend got a full refund on an international flight through Delta Airlines doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get the same result for canceling a domestic flight on Spirit.\n\nRelated: Your complete guide to traveling during the coronavirus outbreak\n\nHere\u2019s where a sales negotiation strategy called \u201cbig ask, little ask\u201d could help you accomplish your goal.\n\nThe concept here is to have at least two satisfactory outcomes in mind, and to ask for the bigger favor first. If that fails, then ask for the smaller favor. In contrast, the smaller request will seem easier to grant, and you\u2019ll be more likely to get what you ask for.\n\nYour success will vary based on a lot of factors, but it never hurts to try \u2014 and it really pays to be as polite as humanly possible.\n\nLet\u2019s say you purchased a $400 nonrefundable ticket, and your airline is offering you free changes for the travel dates. But the event you wanted to attend was canceled, so you no longer plan to take this trip. When you reach out to customer service, go for the \u201cbig ask\u201d first: A full refund. Be polite, explain your circumstances, and nicely ask if the agent can help you out. If the answer is yes, then great; if no, then switch to your \u201clittle ask\u201d, which could be a voucher toward future travel instead of rescheduling your flight.\n\nRelated: I booked my canceled trip using an airline voucher. Will the airline issue me a new one?\u00a0\n\nChances are, you\u2019ll find some leniency from the representative. And even if you don\u2019t, you can walk away knowing you did your best.\n\nPriority goes to travelers who need immediate assistance\n\nTrying to cancel a spring break trip in April? Don\u2019t get on the phone; save customer service hotlines for people who need immediate help resolving their travel issues.\n\nRelated: Use Chase\u2019s online tool to rebook or cancel your Ultimate Rewards itinerary\n\nInstead, reach out to your airline or online travel agency (OTA) via email, Twitter or text. You can avoid long hold times, possibly increase your chances of getting a favorable response, and know that you\u2019re doing your fellow traveler a favor by freeing up the phone lines.\n\nRemember that you\u2019re on the same team \u2014 and be kind\n\nThese are stressful times with little to no prior precedent, and it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed. Remember that you and the customer service agent share the same goal of getting you where you need to go, even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way.\n\nAlso keep in mind that these agents have been dealing with frustrated customers for weeks, and are facing job uncertainty themselves. Be kind and thoughtful to the person helping you \u2014 a \u201cthank you\u201d or a \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d goes a long, long way right now.\n\nFeatured photo by Getty Images.\n",
