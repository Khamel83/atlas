      "Selection": "\u201cReader Questions\u201d are answered twice a week by TPG Associate Editor Brendan Dorsey.\n\nThe Marriott and SPG programs are now officially combined, but many customers still have a number of questions, especially regarding how lifetime elites will be treated in the new system.\u00a0TPG reader Roger wrote in asking how his lifetime Marriott Platinum elite will be grandfathered into the new program\u2026\n\nHas anyone been grandfathered into Lifetime Premier Platinum status from your Marriott Lifetime Platinum elite status?\n\nTPG Reader Roger\n\nWhen Marriott originally announced the status levels in the new program, there were a lot of concerns about how SPG Lifetime Platinums would be integrated into those levels. However, Marriott has since made a few viable paths for those looking to get top-tier lifetime elite status.\n\nTo understand how this will all work, you first have to realize that the merger is effectively broken into two parts, with some changes not taking effect until 2019. Through the end of this year, you can book top-tier hotels at reduced rates and rebook hotels using new Marriott points, but other parts of the programs are still in flux.\n\nPeople who are transferring lifetime status to the new program are impacted by this two-part rollout method.\u00a0When you combine your Marriott and SPG accounts, lifetime elite members from either program will have one of three lifetime status levels for the rest of 2018 \u2014 Silver, Gold or Platinum.\u00a0For those who want to make sure they\u2019re grandfathered into the new Lifetime Premier Platinum status in 2019, you\u2019ll need to fall into one of these four groups:\n\nCurrent Marriott Rewards Lifetime Platinum members.\n\nLifetime SPG Platinum members with 750 or more nights\u00a0by December 31, 2018.\n\nMarriott members who reached 750 nights + 2 million base points at legacy Marriott properties\u00a0by December 31, 2018.\n\nAny Marriott/SPG/Ritz member who reached 750 nights + 10 years of Platinum status across the combined portfolio\u00a0by December 31, 2018 (meaning someone with 250 nights and 5 years of SPG Platinum and 500 nights and 5 years of Platinum with Marriott would end up as a Lifetime Platinum Premier).\n\nIn Roger\u2019s case, since he\u2019s already a Marriott Lifetime Platinum, he\u2019ll get Lifetime Premier Platinum status automatically, but he won\u2019t receive his new lifetime status until next year.\u00a0For any Lifetime Platinums who might not currently meet one of the above criteria, you still have until December 31 to get there. And if you\u2019re not sure how your specific lifetime status will translate into the new program, you can read\u00a0TPG Editor-at-Large\u00a0Nick Ewen\u2019s guide to\u00a0\u201cLifetime Status With the New Marriott: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\u201d\n\nThanks for the question, Roger, and if\u00a0you\u2019re a\u00a0TPG\u00a0reader who\u2019d like us to answer a question of your own,\u00a0tweet us at\u00a0@thepointsguy, message us on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or email us at\u00a0info@thepointsguy.com.
