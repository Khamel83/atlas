      "Selection": "Baking a loaf of bread from scratch seems like the quintessential winter cooking project. The coziness of a warm kitchen and the smell of freshly-baked bread are so comforting on a cold day that it feels weird to even think about them in summertime. But believe me: if you\u2019re new to bread making and a little intimidated by the process, you should start now, in late summer, while your house is still warm enough for dough to rise. \n\nThere are a lot of moving parts to contend with in bread making, only some of which you can actually control. The ones you can\u2019t\u2014namely, the temperature and humidity of your kitchen\u2014are so important to the rising process that they\u2019re almost ingredients unto themselves. Developing your dough instincts in late summer, when those two conditions are ideal for baking, sets you up for early success rather than crushing defeat. And after a month of practicing on easy mode, you\u2019ll be better equipped to troubleshoot recipes in the Cold Dark Times yet to come. \n\nFar too many home cooks have a mental block about homemade bread. This is a huge bummer: bread is\u2026\n\nRead more Read\n\nThis goes for any kind of bread you could possibly want to make. Notoriously slow-rising enriched doughs like challah and brioche come to life in a slightly warm kitchen, rather than sitting like buttery rocks in the proofing bowl for hours on end as they do in the dead of winter. If you\u2019re curious about naturally-leavened breads, those three-day-long folding, shaping, and baking processes will never be more straightforward than they are right now. But I firmly believe that bread making is only as complicated as you want it to be, and for most people, that means it\u2019s gotta be a lot simpler than sourdough, brioche, or even an overnight no-knead bread. \n\nEnter my favorite bread recipe, which is an adaptation of Alexandra Stafford\u2019s mom\u2019s truly excellent Peasant Bread recipe. I will never shut up about it. This isn\u2019t just no-knead bread\u2014it\u2019s same-day no-knead bread. In a roughly 72\u00baF kitchen, the dough rises in less than two hours; once that\u2019s done, you scrape it into a buttered pan and let it rise again while your oven preheats. It bakes for 30-40 minutes, after which you\u2019ll have soft, springy bread with a buttery crust\u2014perfect for sandwiches, croutons, dipping in stews, or the last few tomato mayo toasts of the season. \n\nWhile Stafford\u2019s recipe is basically flawless as written, over time I\u2019ve adjusted my version to use less water, a touch more salt, and loaf pans rather than Pyrex bowls. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to make it:\n\nA large mixing bowl\n\n3 cups (375 grams) all-purpose flour\n\n1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast\n\n1 1/2 teaspoons table salt\n\n1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar\n\n1 1/4 cups (275 grams) lukewarm water (90\u00ba-100\u00ba F)\n\n1 standard loaf pan (8 1/2\u201d x 4 1/2\u201d or 9\u201d x 5\u201d)\n\nSalted or unsalted butter, for greasing\n\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the flour, yeast, salt, and sugar until thoroughly combined. Stir in the water with a flexible spatula, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl until you can\u2019t see any dry flour. Cover with plastic or a damp, clean towel and let rise for 1 1/2-2 hours. The dough should be bubbly, jiggly, and more than twice its original size.\n\nSet a rack in the middle of your oven and preheat it to 425\u00baF. Grease your loaf pan. Using the same nonstick spatula, release the dough from the sides of the bowl, pulling upwards from the bottom as you go to form a very rough ball. (Seriously, don\u2019t sweat the shape\u2014it\u2019s never perfect.) Scrape the dough into the prepared pan and let rise until it peeks over the edge, another 30-45 minutes. Transfer to the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through so it browns evenly, then reduce the heat to 350\u00baF and bake for another 10-15 minutes. Immediately turn out onto a cooling rack and do your best to let it cool before slicing. You just made bread. Look at you go! \n\nI recommend making this as-is at least once or twice to get your bread legs, then messing around with it however you\u2019d like. Sometimes I add a splash of vinegar or a few tablespoons of yogurt to the water for some tang; for pizza dough or focaccia, I\u2019ll add a quarter cup of olive oil and extra salt. It\u2019s possible that you\u2019ll decide that one bread recipe is all you need, but this could also be your gateway into a bread making obsession. Either way, you\u2019ll have at least one homemade bread recipe down cold by the time stew and braise season rolls around. \n",
