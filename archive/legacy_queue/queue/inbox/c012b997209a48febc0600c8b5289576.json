      "Selection": "Domestic first class is nicer than coach, but, in most cases, it\u2019s hardly something to write home about.\u00a0 Usually you\u2019ll simply get a bigger seat and a few snacks and drinks, or a meal if you\u2019re lucky.\u00a0 If you\u2019re really lucky, you might find yourself on an internationally configured aircraft flying a domestic route.\u00a0 On these you\u2019ll generally find large business class seats with electronic controls to adjust the recline all the way to flat if you\u2019d like.\u00a0 Additionally, the big three airlines (AA, Delta, United) have rolled out premium business class seating on a number of their transcontinental routes (LAX to JFK, for example).\u00a0 Of course, they have also rolled out higher award prices for those transcon business class seats.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to fly first class (who wouldn\u2019t?), it is often possible to pay fewer miles by booking with foreign carrier miles.\u00a0 Below you\u2019ll find domestic business/first class award prices for each of the big three, along with the best options for using foreign miles, and quick tips for how to get those miles.\n\nKeep in mind that in all cases you\u2019ll have to find saver level award space on the airline you want to fly before you can book that flight with a partner airline\u2019s miles.\n\nFly AA Domestic Business or First Class\n\nAA premium transcon\n\nAmerican Airlines charges 25K one-way for 2-cabin first class, or 32.5K one-way business class.\u00a0 Here are the best alternatives:\n\nJAL (Japan Airlines Mileage Bank): 32K to 42K round-trip (or one-way) for flights totaling 4,000 miles or less.\n\nCathay Pacific Asia Miles: 30K to 50K round-trip depending upon the length of the flight (use this online calculator to find the price).\n\nEtihad Guest: 25K one-way for business / first class. 32.5K one-way for \u201cPremium\u201d (note: I\u2019m not sure if premium in this case means transcon business class or 3 cabin first class. My guess is the latter). Etihad\u2019s award chart for flying AA can be found here.\n\nBritish Airways Avios: 15K one-way for short (up to 1,150 miles) direct flights.\n\nMy take: For round trip travel, JAL and Cathay Pacific offer great award prices. JAL allows booking AA awards directly online. Cathay allows making an award request online, but the award is confirmed offline.\u00a0 Overall, Cathay may be the best choice despite the more cumbersome award booking procedure because their miles are easy to get.\n\nHow to get the miles:\n\nAA: Sign up for Citi AA cards or Barclaycard AA cards; or transfer from SPG/Marriott.\n\nJAL: Transfer from SPG.\n\nCathay Pacific: Sign up for Cathay credit card; or transfer from Citi ThankYou Rewards, Amex Membership Rewards, or SPG.\n\nEtihad Guest: Transfer from Citi ThankYou Rewards, Amex Membership Rewards, or SPG.\n\nBritish Airways: Sign up for the Chase British Airways credit card; or transfer from Amex Membership Rewards, Chase Ultimate Rewards, or SPG/Marriott.\n\nSee also: Top 10 shortcuts to earning SPG points; Amassing Membership Rewards; Amassing Ultimate Rewards.\n\nBooking Tip for booking AA with JAL miles:\n\nJAL\u2019s Mileage Bank program has a distance based award chart.\u00a0 With most domestic flights, JAL requires only 32,000 to 42,000 miles to fly business class or two-cabin first class on American Airlines or Alaska Airlines.\u00a0 Longer flights such as LAX to JFK roundtrip exceed the 4,000 mile sweetspot, but you could fly LAX to JFK then return as far as Dallas (for example) in first or business class for as few as 42,000 miles. You can search for award availability online through JAL\u2019s site, but you must sign up for a free account first.\n\nFly Delta Domestic Business or First Class\n\nDelta premium transcon\n\nDelta no longer publishes an award chart, so the best you can do to find their award pricing is use Delta\u2019s award calendar to try to find the best rates.\u00a0\u00a0 At the time of this writing I\u2019ve found that Delta domestic first class and business class awards range from 17.5K to 53K one-way.\u00a0 Here are the best alternatives:\n\nVirgin Atlantic: 25K one-way for direct flights (if a flight requires multiple segments, the award price is higher).\u00a0 See this post for tips on booking Delta awards with Virgin Atlantic awards.\n\nKorean Air: 45K round-trip.\u00a0 See this post for tips on booking Delta awards with Korean Air miles.\n\nMy take: For round trip travel Korean Air has terrific prices, but their online booking tool is a challenge to use.\u00a0 They also have rules against booking awards for anyone but family members and you have to prove that they\u2019re really in your family.\u00a0 Virgin Atlantic\u2019s website is a bit buggy, but it\u2019s much easier to use than Korean\u2019s and it includes a useful award calendar.\u00a0 Plus, Virgin Atlantic miles are much easier to collect than Korean Air miles.\u00a0 And, best of all, Virgin Atlantic sometimes finds award space on Delta that other Delta partners cannot see.\u00a0 If you\u2019re planning to fly direct, the slight premium Virgin Atlantic charges over Korean Air is, in my opinion, completely worth it.\n\nHow to get the miles:\n\nDelta: Sign up for Delta credit cards; or transfer from Amex Membership Rewards or SPG/Marriott.\n\nVirgin Atlantic: Sign up for the Virgin Atlantic card; or transfer from\u00a0Amex Membership Rewards,\u00a0Chase Ultimate Rewards, Citi ThankYou Rewards, or SPG/Marriott.\n\nKorean Air: Sign up for Korean Air credit cards; or transfer from Chase Ultimate Rewards, or SPG.\n\nSee also: Top 10 shortcuts to earning SPG points; Amassing Membership Rewards; Amassing Ultimate Rewards.\n\nTip for booking Delta awards with Virgin Atlantic miles:\n\nVirgin Atlantic\u2019s website award booking tool auto-completes your typing in the leftmost box titled \u201cI\u2019m flying From\u201d, but not the one on the right titled \u201cTo\u201d except for select Virgin Atlantic airport destinations.\u00a0 An easy workaround is to click the little map pin icon to search by country or alphabetically.\u00a0 Another workaround is to type your destination into the \u201cfrom\u201d box and copy and paste the result into the \u201cTo\u201d box.\u00a0 Most, if not all, US airports can be found this way, but many international destinations that Delta serves are not available online.\u00a0 For these, you have to call Virgin Atlantic to find and book awards.\n\nFly United Domestic Business or First Class\n\nUnited premium transcon\n\nUnited charges 25K one-way 2-cabin first class, or 35K one-way premium transcon business class.\u00a0 Here are the best alternatives:\n\nLufthansa Miles & More: 17K one-way\n\nSingapore: 20K one-way\n\nAeroplan (Air Canada): 25K one-way\n\nMy take: Both Lufthansa and Singapore require calling to book award flights on United.\u00a0 I\u2019ve never booked with Lufthansa miles, but I\u2019ve done so a number of times with Singapore.\u00a0 For me, they\u2019ve always answered quickly and were a pleasure to deal with.\u00a0 Since Singapore miles are much easier to get than Lufthansa miles, I think that Singapore is worth the slight premium in award costs.\n\nHow to get the miles:\n\nUnited: Sign up for United credit cards; or transfer from Chase Ultimate Rewards or SPG/Marriott.\n\nLufthansa: Sign up for the Miles & More credit card; or transfer from SPG.\n\nSingapore: Transfer from\u00a0Amex Membership Rewards,\u00a0Chase Ultimate Rewards, Citi ThankYou Rewards, or SPG.\n\nAeroplan: Transfer from\u00a0Amex Membership Rewards or SPG.\n\nSee also: Top 10 shortcuts to earning SPG points; Amassing Membership Rewards; Amassing Ultimate Rewards.\n\nUnited Booking Tip:\n\nBefore trying to book with a foreign carrier\u2019s miles (especially when they don\u2019t let you book United flights online), look for business/first class award space on United.com without logging in.\u00a0 Look for First Saver Award space (or Business Saver Award space on a 3 cabin flight) that looks like this:\n\nFly Alaska First Class\n\nThis section is coming soon.\u00a0 For now note that you can book Alaska flights with partners such as AA, Cathay Pacific, and Korean Air.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEarn Miles Without Flying: START HERE\t\n\nThe post Best options for domestic first class awards appeared first on Frequent Miler.",
