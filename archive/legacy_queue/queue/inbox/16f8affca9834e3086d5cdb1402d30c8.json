      "Title": "A halal guide to mind-blowing sex is teaching Muslim women how to set the bed on fire Quartz",
      "Selection": "Even at a slender 65 pages, The Muslimah Sex Manual: A Halal Guide to Mind Blowing Sex packs comprehensiveness. A handbook for Muslim women seeking satisfying love lives, the book starts with the basics\u2014lessons on kissing, sending dirty texts, and the importance of foreplay. After that come chapters on sex positions, shower sex, bondage, and masochism.\n\n\u201cThis is the best way to vary your sex life,\u201d said the author, who writes under the pen name Umm Muladhat.\n\nThe Muslimah Sex Manual, independently published in mid-July, has been variously described as groundbreaking and a welcome step. It busts the myth, parading as an Islamic belief, that a pure Muslim cannot be dirty in bed, while giving candid advice. Embedded in it is the message that Muslim women should enjoy a fulfilling sex life.\n\n\u201cYou can be pure as snow and still be dirty in bed,\u201d says the manual. \u201cWhat is amusing (in a sad way) is that many younger Muslims think that the practicing, masjid going, hijab/niqab wearing sisters have dull sex lives and never venture outside of the vanilla.\u201d\n\nGreetings sisters! A wonderful book! I'm thinking of buying one for my auntie Lillah. The Muslimah Sex Manual. http://pic.twitter.com/ITdhAC4XvA\n\n\u2014 Umm Ratwa (@ummratwa3) July 18, 2017\n\nIt was a newlywed friend who motivated Muladhat, a practicing Muslim, to write. The friend protested that although she knew how to have sex, she didn\u2019t really know sex. She didn\u2019t know what her husband liked. And, more importantly, she didn\u2019t know what she liked.\n\nThat was the beginning of Muladhat\u2019s impromptu workshops. Everything she had learnt over the course of her marriage, she taught her friend, \u201cfervently hoping that it would help her in her marital life\u201d. A month later, when they met again, her friend was beaming. Muladhat was told: \u201cPlease, write this down and share it with other Muslim girls. No one teaches this. We\u2019re thrown into marriage and only know the fiqh (laws taught according to the Quran) and the biology.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s what she did.\n\nThe manual details myriad ways to engage a partner, and lists around 100 positions\u2014cowgirl, reverse cowgirl, final furlong, Amazon, among them. \u201cSome couples never move beyond missionary position. If that\u2019s what you two enjoy, that\u2019s perfectly fine! However, not every couple wants to stay vanilla every time.\u201d\n\nAccording to Muladhat, halal sex has some key rules: avoid anal sex, penetrative sex during menstruation, and sex outside of marriage. Pornography too is forbidden\u2014\u201cporn is a lie,\u201d she writes, \u201cporn is one of the worst ways to learn about sex.\u201d\n\nMe reading The Muslimah Sex Manual: A Halal Guide to Mind Blowing Sex on the night of my wedding http://pic.twitter.com/5Vqwonj1x3\n\n\u2014 squidward (@bitterbrowngirl) July 18, 2017\n\nMuladhat grew up in a practicing Muslim family but never was she taught to be guilty about sex. \u201cIt was never portrayed as something dirty, nor as something that I should feel ashamed about,\u201d she said in an email interview with Scroll.in. \u201cIslam does not criticize sex, see it as dirty, or drum guilt into women. I was taught that sex is something between a husband and wife. Outside of marriage, yes, a person should feel guilty about indulging in it. Inside of marriage, however, it is something to enjoy.\u201d\n\nMuladhat and her husband too have experimented in the bedroom. \u201cAlhamdulillah, my husband and I have always had good communication,\u201d she said. Their go-to source for new ideas is Christian sex and intimacy books because, unlike mainstream guides, these do not include explicit images.\n\nSince the publication of The Muslimah Sex Manual, Muladhat has received a few angry comments. Critics, the few there are, say the book fetishises Muslim women and encourages promiscuity. Muladhat expected this, which is why she chose to publish under a nom de plume. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to become forever associated with the book such that if any future employer would Google my name, they would find this book. My husband is aware I\u2019ve authored the book and has helped me revise it. My friends are not aware, and I intend to keep it this way.\u201d\n\nThe next project\n\nThe few criticisms aside, the reaction to the book has been overwhelmingly positive. In an interview to The Guardian, Shaista Gohir, chairperson of the helpline Muslim Women\u2019s Network (UK), said: \u201cI\u2019m all for women talking about sex. Why shouldn\u2019t they? Talking about sex in Islam is not new, and past scholars highlighted the importance of sexual pleasure for women, which included advice for men to ensure this happens.\u201d\n\nMuladhat told the Huffington Post that she received a letter from a Muslim leader who plans to distribute copies of her book to couples undergoing premarital counselling at his mosque. \u201cHe specifically mentioned that he had long felt the need for a book which would talk frankly about sex in marriage without either being so explicit that it bordered on the profane or so bland that it became useless. His only criticism was that he wanted to know why the book was focused only on Muslim women and not Muslim men.\u201d\n\nMuladhat does not plan to disappoint. Her next project is a book aimed at men. \u201cI think it\u2019ll actually be easier than the Muslimah Manual as I have the added perspective of being a woman and thus knowing what my husband does that works. He\u2019ll obviously play a bigger role in helping me write the book than he did in writing the current one.\u201d\n\nThis post first appeared on Scroll.in.
