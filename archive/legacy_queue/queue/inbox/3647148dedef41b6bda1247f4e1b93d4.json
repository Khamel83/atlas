      "Title": "An American Muslim comedian on being typecast as a terrorist \u2014 and being mistaken for one Vox - All",
      "Selection": "If you turn on your TV, his face might well pop up in late-night fare like Steel Sharks, Executive Decision, and Roseanne. His lines are almost always the same \u2014 \"Death to America!\" \"I will kill you, American scum!\" For years, Ahmed Ahmed played the terrorist.\n\nUntil he decided to stop.\n\nWhen he rejected bad-guy roles, his phone stopped ringing \u2014 there were no other casting calls for him. \"There were just no parts for a guy like me,\" says Ahmed, who considers himself to be \"as American as you can get.\" So he started waiting tables at a lousy restaurant, where he was forced to sharpen his wit in order to get tips. \"That's when I started thinking about becoming a comedian.\"\n\nEventually Ahmed realized that the only way he could change his professional life \u2014 and maybe change how Americans actually perceive Arabs and more broadly, Muslims \u2014 was to write his own lines. Watch this episode of The Secret Life of Muslims to see how Ahmed goes from cracking heads \u2026 to cracking jokes.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This is the first in a series of videos called \"The Secret Life of Muslims,\" by director Joshua Seftel. We'll be releasing more over the coming weeks.\n",
