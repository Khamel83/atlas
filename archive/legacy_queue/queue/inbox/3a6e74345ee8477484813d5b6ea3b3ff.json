      "Title": "The perfect is the enemy of the good Get Rich Slowly",
      "Selection": "I\u2019m home! Over the past two weeks, I drove 1625 miles across across seven southeastern states. I had a blast hanging out with readers, friends, and colleagues. Plus, it was fun to explore some parts of the country that Kim and I skipped during our RV trip a few years ago. Most fun of all, though, was talking to dozens of different people about money.\n\nAfter two weeks of money talk, I have a lot to think about. I was struck, for instance, by how many people are paralyzed by the need to make perfect decisions. They\u2019re afraid of making mistakes with their money, so instead of moving forward, they freeze \u2014 like a deer in headlights.\n\nIt might seem strange to claim that the pursuit of perfection prevents people from achieving their financial aims, but it\u2019s true. Long-time readers know that this is a key part of my financial philosophy: The perfect is the enemy of the good.\n\nHere, for instance, is a typical reader email:\n\nThirty-plus years ago I was making much less money than when I retired so my tax rate was lower. I sometimes wonder now if it would have been better to pay the taxes at the time I earned the money and invest and pay taxes all along rather than deferring the taxes. You can make yourself crazy thinking about stuff like that!\n\nYes, you can make yourself crazy thinking about stuff like that. This reader retired early and has zero debt. They\u2019re in great financial shape. Yet they\u2019re fretting over the fact that tax-deferred investments might not have been the optimal choice back in 1986.\n\nRegret is one of the perils of perfectionism. There are others. Let\u2019s look at why so many smart people find themselves fighting the urge to be perfect.\n\nMaximizers and Satisficers\n\nFor a long time, I was a perfectionist. When I had to make a decision, I only wanted to choose the best. At the same time, I was a deeply unhappy man who never got anything done. Although I didn\u2019t realize it at the time, the pursuit of perfection was the root of my problems.\n\nIn 2005, I read The Paradox of Choice by Barry Schwartz. This fascinating book explores how a culture of abundance actually robs us of satisfaction. We believe more options will make us happier, but the increased choice actually has the opposite effect. Especially for perfectionists.\n\nSchwartz divides the world into two types of people: maximizers and satisficers. Here\u2019s how he describes the difference:\n\nChoosing wisely begins with developing a clear understanding of your goals. And the first choice you must make is between the goal of choosing the absolute best and choosing something that is good enough. If you seek and accept only the best, you are a maximizer\u2026Maximizers need to be assured that every purchase or decision was the best that could be made.\n\nIn other words, maximizers are perfectionists.\n\n\u201cThe alternative to maximizing is to be a satisficer,\u201d writes Schwartz. \u201cTo satisfice is to settle for something that is good enough and not worry about the possibility that there might be something better.\u201d\n\nTo maximizers, this sounds like heresy. Settle for good enough? \u201cGood enough seldom is!\u201d proclaims the perfectionist. To her, the satisficer seems to lack standards. But that\u2019s not true.\n\nA satisficer does have standards, and they\u2019re often clearly defined. The difference is that a satisficer is content with excellent while a maximizer is on a quest for perfect.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the interesting thing: All of this maximizing in pursuit of perfection actually leads to less satisfaction and happiness, not more. Here\u2019s what Schwartz says about his research:\n\nPeople with high maximization [tendencies] experienced less satisfaction with life, were less optimistic, and were more depressed than people with low maximization [tendencies]\u2026Maximizers are much more susceptible than satisficers to all forms of regret.\n\nSchwartz is careful to note that being a maximizer is correlated with unhappiness; there\u2019s no evidence of a causal relationship. Still, it seems safe to assume that there is a connection.\n\nI\u2019ve seen it in my own life.\n\nMaximizing in Real Life\n\nFor a long, long time, I was a maximizer. When I had to make any sort of decision, I researched the hell out of it. I wanted to buy and do and have only the best. But you know what? No matter how much time I put into picking the perfect product, it always fell short of my expectations. That\u2019s because there\u2019s no such thing as a perfect product.\n\nIn the olden days, for instance, if I needed to buy a dishwasher, I would make an elaborate spreadsheet to collate all of my options. I\u2019d then consult the latest Consumer Reports buying guide, check Amazon reviews, and search for other resources to help guide my decision. I\u2019d enter all of the data into my spreadsheet, then try to find the best option.\n\nThe trouble? There was rarely one best option for any choice I was trying to make. One dishwasher might use less energy while another produced cleaner dishes. This dishwasher might have special wine holders while that had the highest reliability scores. How was I supposed to find the perfect machine? Why couldn\u2019t one manufacturer combine everything into one Super Dishwasher?\n\nIt was an impossible quest, and I know that now.\n\nNowadays, I\u2019m mostly able to ignore my maximizing tendencies. I\u2019ve taught myself to be a satisficer. When I had to replace my dead dishwasher three years ago, I didn\u2019t aim for perfection. Instead, I made a plan and stuck to it.\n\nFirst, I set a budget. Because it would cost about $700 to repair our old dishwasher, I allowed myself that much for a new appliance.\n\nNext, I picked one store and shopped from its universe of available dishwashers.\n\nAfter that, I limited myself to only a handful of brands, the ones whose quality I trusted most.\n\nFinally, I gave myself a time limit. Instead of spending days trying to find the Best Dishwasher Ever, I allocated a couple of hours on a weekend afternoon to find an acceptable model.\n\nArmed with my Consumer Reports buying guide (and my phone so that I could look stuff up online), I marched into the local Sears outlet center. In less than an hour, I had narrowed my options from thirty dishwashers to three. With Kim\u2019s help, I picked a winner.\n\nThe process was quick and easy. The dishwasher has served us well for the past three years, and I\u2019ve had zero buyer\u2019s remorse.\n\nA Trivial Example\nAt Camp FI in January, one of the attendees explained that he\u2019s found freedom through letting go of trivial decisions. For things that won\u2019t have a lasting impact on his life, he doesn\u2019t belabor his options. Instead, he makes a quick decision and moves on.\n\nIn restaurants, for instance, he doesn\u2019t look at every item on the menu. He doesn\u2019t try to optimize his order. Instead, he makes a quick pass through the list, then picks the first thing that catches his eye. \u201cIt sounds silly,\u201d he told me, \u201cbut doing this makes a huge difference to my happiness.\u201d\n\nFor the past four months, I\u2019ve been trying this technique. You know what? It works! I now make menu choices in seconds rather than minutes, and my dining experience is better because of it. This is a trivial example, I know, but it\u2019s also illustrative of the point I\u2019m trying to make.\n\nPerfect Procrastinators\n\nStudies have shown that perfectionists are more likely to have physical and mental problems than those who are open-minded and flexible. There\u2019s another drawback to the pursuit of perfect: It costs time \u2014 and lots of it. To find the best option, whether it\u2019s the top dishwasher or the ideal index fund, can take days or weeks or months. (And sometimes it\u2019s an impossible mission.)\n\nThe pursuit of perfection is an exercise in diminishing returns:\n\nA bit of initial research is usually enough to glean the basics needed to make a smart decision.\n\nA little additional research is enough to help you separate the wheat from the chaff.\n\nA moderate amount of time brings you to the point where you can make an informed decision and obtain quality results.\n\nTheoretically, if you had unlimited time, you might find the perfect option.\n\nThe more time you spend on research, the better your results are likely to be. But each unit of time you spend in search of higher quality offers less reward than the unit of time before.\n\nQuality is important. You should absolutely take time to research your investment and buying decisions. But remember that perfect is a moving target, one that\u2019s almost impossible to hit. It\u2019s usually better to shoot for \u201cgood enough\u201d today than to aim for a perfect decision next week.\n\nProcrastination is one common consequence of pursuing perfection: You can come up with all sorts of reasons to put off establishing an emergency fund, to put off cutting up your credit cards, to put off starting a retirement account. But most of the time, your best choice is to start now.\n\nWho cares if you don\u2019t find the best interest rate? Who cares if you don\u2019t find the best mutual fund? You\u2019ve found some good ones, right? Pick one. Get in the game. Just start. Starting plays a greater role in your success than any other factor. There will always be time to optimize in the future.\n\nWhen you spend so much time looking for the \u201cbest\u201d choice that you never actually do anything, you\u2019re sabotaging yourself. The perfect is the enemy of the good.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIf your quest for the best is making you unhappy, then it\u2019s hurting rather than helping. If your desire to get things exactly right is preventing you from taking any sort of positive action, then you\u2019re better off settling for \u201cgood enough\u201d. If you experience regret because you didn\u2019t make an optimal choice in the past, force yourself to look at the sunny side of your decision.\n\nTrain yourself to be a satisficer. Ask yourself what \u201cgood enough\u201d would mean each time you\u2019re faced with a decision. What would it mean to accept that instead of perfection?\n\nIf you must pursue perfection, focus on the big stuff first. I get a lot of email from readers who fall into the optimization trap. They spend too much time and energy perfecting small, unimportant things \u2014 newspaper subscriptions, online savings accounts, etc. \u2014 instead of the things that matter most, such as housing and transportation costs. Fix the broken things first, then optimize the big stuff. After all of that is done, then it makes sense to get the small things perfect.\n\nPractice refinement. Start with \u201cgood enough\u201d, then make incremental improvements over time. Say you\u2019re looking for a new credit card. Instead of spending hours searching for the best option, find a good option and go with it. Then, in the months and years ahead, keep an eye out for better cards. When you find one you like, make the switch. Make perfection a long-term project.\n\nDon\u2019t dwell on the past. If you\u2019ve made mistakes, learn from them and move on. If you\u2019ve made good but imperfect decisions \u2014 such as the Money Boss reader who wishes they hadn\u2019t saved so much in tax-deferred accounts \u2014 celebrate what you did right instead of dwelling on the minor flaws in the results.\n\nEmbrace the imperfection. Everyone makes mistakes \u2014 even billionaires like Warren Buffett. Don\u2019t let one slip-up drag you down. One key difference between those who succeed and those who don\u2019t is the ability to recover from a setback and keep marching toward a goal. Use failures to learn what not to do next time.\n\nI don\u2019t think perfection is a bad thing. It\u2019s a noble goal. It\u2019s not wrong to want the best for yourself and your family. But I think it\u2019s important to recognize when the pursuit of perfection stands in your way rather than helps you build a better life.\n\nThe post The perfect is the enemy of the good appeared first on Get Rich Slowly.\n",
