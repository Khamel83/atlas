Now, the creators behind some of the show\u2019s greatest half hours talk about TV\u2019s most enduring institution.\n(Dan Evans)\nOn April 19, 1987, Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie made their debut during a short on The Tracey Ullman Show. Two years later, Fox gave them their own program. In the three decades since, The Simpsons has become an American institution. To celebrate the 30th birthday of the greatest set of television characters of all time, let\u2019s look back at the stories behind the 100 best Simpsons episodes.\n\nTo compile this list, I sought feedback from both hardcore Simpsons fans and former members of the show\u2019s creative staff. Still, it was an inherently subjective undertaking. \u201cYou could choose every other episode from the first 200 episodes for your top 100 and you wouldn\u2019t be too far off,\u201d one Simpsons writer told me. I don\u2019t claim to be a scientician, but I tried to be meticulous. So crack open a Duff and\u00a0enjoy.\n\nThe Insider\u2019s Guide to the 100 Best \u2018Simpsons\u2019 Episodes Ever was originally published in The Ringer on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",
