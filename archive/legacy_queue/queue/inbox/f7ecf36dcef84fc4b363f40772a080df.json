      "Selection": "Start Black History Month by giving it a read.\n \nGoogle is kicking off Black History Month this year by celebrating the legacy of Sojourner Truth, the subject of today\u2019s Google Doodle. Which means that it\u2019s time to reread one of the great works of American rhetoric: Truth\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman\u201d speech. \n\nSojourner Truth was born into slavery at the end of the 18th century, but she escaped \u2014 carrying her infant daughter with her \u2014 in 1826. (\u201cI did not run off, for I thought that wicked, but I walked off, believing that to be all right,\u201d she would later say.) When the son she left behind was sold illegally, she successfully sued for his freedom as well. Naming herself \u201cSojourner Truth,\u201d she converted to Methodism and began campaigning for women\u2019s rights and the abolition of slavery.\n\nShe improvised her \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman\u201d speech in 1851 at the Ohio Women\u2019s Rights Convention in Akron. The exact wording of the speech has been contested. In contemporary transcriptions, the famous question \u201cain\u2019t I a woman?\u201d doesn\u2019t appear anywhere, and some historians have argued that native New Yorker Truth is unlikely to have spoken in the Southern-inflected English that tinges the most widely reproduced version of the speech.\n\nBut regardless of Truth\u2019s precise wording, the message at the core of \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman\u201d rings powerfully true 168 years later: that women can change the world, and that Truth\u2019s blackness did not make her not a woman. That\u2019s the kind of intersectionality that Truth was immensely skilled at navigating, despite the enormous pressure on women of color at the time to choose between the women\u2019s movement and the abolitionist movement. Truth never chose. As she pointed out in her speech, she shouldn\u2019t have to.\n\nHere\u2019s the speech in full:\n\nWell, children, where there is so much racket there must be something out of kilter. I think that \u2018twixt the negroes of the South and the women at the North, all talking about rights, the white men will be in a fix pretty soon. But what\u2019s all this here talking about?\n\nThat man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud-puddles, or gives me any best place! And ain\u2019t I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! And ain\u2019t I a woman? I could work as much and eat as much as a man - when I could get it - and bear the lash as well! And ain\u2019t I a woman? I have borne thirteen children, and seen most all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother\u2019s grief, none but Jesus heard me! And ain\u2019t I a woman?\n\nThen they talk about this thing in the head; what\u2019s this they call it? [member of audience whispers, \u201cintellect\u201d] That\u2019s it, honey. What\u2019s that got to do with women\u2019s rights or negroes\u2019 rights? If my cup won\u2019t hold but a pint, and yours holds a quart, wouldn\u2019t you be mean not to let me have my little half measure full?\n\nThen that little man in black there, he says women can\u2019t have as much rights as men, \u2018cause Christ wasn\u2019t a woman! Where did your Christ come from? Where did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him.\n\nIf the first woman God ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down all alone, these women together ought to be able to turn it back , and get it right side up again! And now they is asking to do it, the men better let them.\n\nObliged to you for hearing me, and now old Sojourner ain\u2019t got nothing more to say. \n",
