      "Selection": "If you\u2019re a parent, you\u2019ll relate to this right away. The wife of reddit user jitney86 tracked when their infant slept and ate from 3 to 17 months. It\u2019s a lot of noise and randomness in the beginning, and then hallelujah the schedule starts to converge to something predictable.\n\nThe fact that she was able to collect data for that long is impressive. When my first kid was born, I was fresh off of finishing my PhD with a dissertation on personal data collection. So I thought, \u201cI\u2019m going to track every poop, pee, feeding, and sleep. A pattern\u2026 will emerge!\u201d\n\nOne month later, in a sleep deprived stupor, I realized, \u201cThere is no pattern. There is no pattern. Aaaand there is no pattern.\u201d Then I stopped with the data collection and just focused on minimizing poo leakage. So it\u2019s kind of fun to see this convergence.",
