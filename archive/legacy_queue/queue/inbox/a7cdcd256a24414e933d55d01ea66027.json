      "Title": "We analyzed 750 pairs of jeans and found definitive skinny bias by US retailers Quartz",
      "Selection": "It sounds like hyperbole, but it isn\u2019t: Half of American women struggle to find jeans that fit at the mall. More specifically, only 13% of women\u2019s jeans in brick and mortar stores are available for women of average size or larger.\n\nThe number comes from a Quartz analysis of women\u2019s denim offerings in the Mall of America that bluntly illustrates the reality faced by millions of women in the fitting room. We looked at every store selling women\u2019s apparel in one of America\u2019s largest malls and compared the jean waist sizes on offer to the typical American woman\u2019s waist size. We excluded department stores.\n\nThe median waist size for American women aged 20 years and older is 37.3 inches (94.8 cm), while the average is 38 inches. Most popular retailers don\u2019t produce jeans at either size. It\u2019s 8 inches larger than the median waist size of jeans available at the Mall of America\u201430 inches. It is only one inch smaller than the median of the largest\u00a0sizes carried by these brands.\n\nData are based on sizing charts found on each retailer\u2019s website. When sizes were indicated by a range, we used the average. H&M was excluded because it is currently in the process of changing its sizing.\n\nWhile every retailer that sells womens\u2019 denim offers sizes for customers with a waist smaller than the average, only half provide at least one option for women with a larger waist. The stores with larger sizes often further relegate them to website-only collections.\n\nRetailers use a series of euphemisms to tell shoppers larger than their offerings not to bother coming to the mall. \u201cOnly at oldnavy.com,\u201d \u201cin stock online,\u201d and perhaps the most devious \u201conline exclusive!\u201d are all different ways of telling customers, \u201cdon\u2019t come to our store, we don\u2019t serve your size.\u201d\n\nBlue jeans may be a universal icon of US culture; however, this wearable symbol of capitalism, freedom, and James Dean is only easily accessible to half of American women despite the business opportunity.\u00a0Fashion designer Christian Siriano recently said he tripled his business by adding more inclusive sizing. But faced with limited options for denim, (and of course changing preferences) women have turned to other products. For the first time ever the US has imported more yoga pants than blue jeans.\n",
