      "Title": "This Restaurant-Style Kale Salad Will Change Your Mind About Kale Salad Food52",
      "Selection": "It\u2019s not uncommon to feel as if you\u2019ve seen every rendition of kale salad that exists. I\u2019d certainly felt similarly for years\u2014until recently, when I had the kale salad at Haven\u2019s Kitchen, an all-day cafe/event space/cooking school/all around food lover\u2019s paradise.\n \nThis isn\u2019t just another kale salad recipe. It changed my mind about kale salad. What makes it stand out is the clever technique that instantly transforms it into something extraordinary...or should I say eggstraordinary? (Because all you need are a couple eggs.)\n\n\u201cI freaked. Honestly! It\u2019s so simple,\u201d said Ali Cayne, owner of Haven's Kitchen, when she first learned of the clever method. \u201cI'd never done it or heard of it, and it was mind-blowing.\u201d\n \nBefore you make any assumptions, know that this isn\u2019t your typical put-a-fried-egg-on-top move. In this case, the lightly crisped, runny yolked eggs don\u2019t go on the salad. They go in the salad.\n\n This isn\u2019t just another kale salad recipe. It changed my *mind* about kale salad. \n\nOnce the chopped greens are dressed and the salad is tossed with pretty much anything you like, a couple fried eggs go right on top. A second vigorous mix with a pair of tongs, allows the yolks to mix with the vinaigrette creating a rich, vicious dressing similar to a Caesar, only way easier.\n\n\u201cThe egg yolks help bind the salad together,\u201d explained Haven's Kitchen Chef Adi Fracchia, who\u2019d relied on this pro-tip at home while craving a \u201cyummy and satisfying but secretly healthy\u201d dinner, but only had a few minutes to cook.\n \nIn addition to being the magical ingredient in the creamy dressing, the warmth of the eggs wilt the kale slightly, tenderizing it without having to do a pre-dressing oil massage that many recipes suggest, not to mentioned they speckle the salad with little bits of salty fried eggs.\n \nThe salad was such a hit with the Haven\u2019s Kitchen staff that it occasionally appears on the seasonally rotating menu in the super-chic cafe. But the salad hasn\u2019t just won the hearts of the HK crew and bustling cafe goers, it\u2019s also a favorite of Cayne\u2019s children.\n \n\u201cThey love eggs and the adventure of a fun dish that they get to hunt for stuff in. So finding the bits of fried egg white and cheese is fun for them,\u201d says the mother of five. \u201cThey also love breadcrumbs when I have the bandwidth to make them.\u201d\n \nYou can make Chef Adi\u2019s version with quick-pickled onions and garlicky thyme-flecked breadcrumbs or try the technique with a version of your own. And since the salad is so versatile, you can make it as simple or as sophisticated as you like.\n \n\u201cSometimes I just toss with olive oil, Parm, lemon zest, and Maldon,\" added Cayne. \"The yolk does the rest.\u201d\n\n Haven's Kitchen Kale Salad \n View Recipe \n\nIngredients\n\n1\n \n small (or 1/2 large) red onion, thinly sliced \n\n3/4\n \n cup rice wine vinegar, divided \n\n Kosher salt \n\n1/4\n \n cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for cooking \n\n1\n \n teaspoon honey \n\n1/2\n \n teaspoon Aleppo pepper \n\n1/4\n \n teaspoon freshly ground black pepper \n\n1\n \n cup panko breadcrumbs \n\n3\n \n garlic cloves, finely chopped or grated \n\n1\n \n sprig fresh thyme, leaves removed (optional) \n\n1\n \n large bunch curly or lacinato kale, washed and roughly chopped (about 6 cups total) \n\n3\n \n large eggs \n\n4\n \n ounces feta cheese (about 1/2 cup) \n\n1\n \n small (or 1/2 large) red onion, thinly sliced \n\n3/4\n \n cup rice wine vinegar, divided \n\n Kosher salt \n\n1/4\n \n cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for cooking \n\n1\n \n teaspoon honey \n\n1/2\n \n teaspoon Aleppo pepper \n\n1/4\n \n teaspoon freshly ground black pepper \n\n1\n \n cup panko breadcrumbs \n\n3\n \n garlic cloves, finely chopped or grated \n\n1\n \n sprig fresh thyme, leaves removed (optional) \n\n1\n \n large bunch curly or lacinato kale, washed and roughly chopped (about 6 cups total) \n\n3\n \n large eggs \n\n4\n \n ounces feta cheese (about 1/2 cup) \n\n How do you make your kale salad?
