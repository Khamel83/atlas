      "Selection": "A few days ago, I came across this rather striking finding from a recent public opinion survey by the Public Religion Research Institute:\n\nIt is striking for a couple of reasons. For one thing, the question is not about illegal immigrants, or even immigrants at all, it\u2019s not about crime, or welfare, or jobs ... it\u2019s just about racial diversity as such. And more Republicans are against it than for it! (So much for \u201ceconomic anxiety.\u201d) \n\nBut the question is also notable for its unstated premise: that the growing presence of people other than whites in the US (what else could \u201cincreased racial diversity\u201d mean in a majority white country?) is a subject of active political debate. It is not taken for granted as constitutive of a multiethnic democracy, but treated as a kind of add-on, an extra feature. \u201cIs it working? Maybe we should roll it back. Let\u2019s discuss.\u201d\n\nI tried to imagine how that question might strike, oh, someone whose grandparents immigrated from Uganda. That person is just as much a citizen as any other American. She did not choose to be black and cannot choose to be some other race. But now she hears that it is, at the very least, an open question whether her very presence \u2014 and her choice to have children, to further diversify America \u2014 is detrimental to her country. Is it bad to have her around at all, because she\u2019s black? Let\u2019s discuss.\n\nIt must be alienating to feel like one is on probation in one\u2019s own country, that one\u2019s presence is subject to the approval of white people. And it must be a familiar feeling, especially these days, for everyone who is not white (and male).\n\nIt occurred to me that white people rarely if ever experience questions like this, about their very legitimacy. Do they belong? Is having more of them around good for America?\n\nOne thing white people have never experienced is a poll on whether their presence in their own country is intrinsically detrimental.\n\u2014 David Roberts (@drvox) July 24, 2018\n\nIn fact, I thought to myself, I bet asking the question at all \u2014 not answering it either way, just asking it \u2014 would make a lot of white people flip out. Imagine if they saw that on a poll! \n\nSo, as a bit of goofy provocation, I made just such a poll:\n\nDo white people have a positive or negative effect on America?\n\u2014 David Roberts (@drvox) July 24, 2018\n\nI should have said \u201cimpact,\u201d not \u201ceffect,\u201d to mirror the original poll question. (Twitter really needs some kind of edit feature.) It was not the best zinger ever, and probably not a very constructive way to make a point, but whatever, it was only a tweet. I went and walked my dog.\n\nAs you\u2019ve likely predicted, a lot of white people flipped out. \n\nBy the time I got home, the poll had spread into Trump land, the thread was flooded with MAGA tweeters, and white people were being decisively vindicated in the poll. By Wednesday morning, I was the outrage of the day on the entertainment site The Wrap and on a couple of right-wing news sites. \n\nFor reasons that remain somewhat mysterious to me, the MAGA brigade seems to view their victory in my poll \u2014 as of closing, 82 percent deem white people\u2019s net impact as positive, so congrats to my fellow white people! \u2014 as a grand self-own on my part. Presumably because I cared about this poll, wanted white people to lose, and assumed my followers would send them down to defeat.\n\nThose erroneous assumptions and many more are reflected in the Twitter thread beneath the poll, which I recommend to anyone with a masochistic streak. The words \u201ccuck\u201d and \u201csoy boy\u201d come up a lot, as well as a wide variety of colorful anatomical suggestions.\n\nThe funny thing is, I never said a disparaging word about white people. I only said that, while other groups are accustomed to being discussed and polled and judged, white people aren\u2019t, and they would freak out if they saw a question like the one in the PRRI poll about themselves. \n\nThen they saw one, completely missed the context, and freaked out, right on cue, thus proving my point in real time. But they won my Twitter poll, so ... burn, I guess?\n\nIt\u2019s all pretty silly. In 24 hours, everyone involved will have moved on to being outraged about something else. The only lesson I feel certain about: Twitter is terrible, and no one should ever tweet again, even though we all know we\u2019re going to.\n\nBut maybe there\u2019s a little insight to be gleaned. I do think the reaction illuminates a larger point.\n\n        Shutterstock\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the real racist, and white people rule\u201d\n\nI kept up with the first few hundred responses (there are over a thousand now), and it\u2019s interesting to see what they shared and where they differed.\n\nSubstantively (if you can call it that), there were two basic reactions. One is to say that I\u2019m a racist, or liberals are the real racists, because they keep calling attention to race and dividing people up by race, while conservatives are just trying to be individuals and judge people by the content of their character. It\u2019s the \u201cNo puppet! You\u2019re the puppet!\u201d of racism.\n\nThe other kind of response was, to paraphrase: Of course white people are good for America, white people are America, and America, like every other shithole nation white people conquered, would still be a shithole if not for white people.\n\n(I\u2019m not going to pluck out individual tweets and embed them here because I don\u2019t want to drag individuals on Twitter into a public dispute like this; you can read the thread to see if I\u2019m characterizing it accurately.)\n\nThese are mutually contradictory points, of course. \u201cYou\u2019re the real racist, and white people rule.\u201d But they are both very familiar in conservative rhetoric and both delivered behind the same aesthetic, using the same keywords, in the same jumbled tone of fury and contempt. \n\nI didn\u2019t answer the question I asked, but asking it was enough to trigger all the same outrage. Why is that?\n\n        Shutterstock\n\nRacial \u201cpriming\u201d happens well before racial decline\n\nOn his podcast, Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein recently interviewed Yale psychologist Jennifer Richeson, noting she \u201chas done pioneering work on the way perceptions of demographic threat and change affect people\u2019s political opinions, voting behavior, and ideas about themselves.\u201d \n\nOne of Richeson\u2019s key insights is that reminders of coming demographic decline \u2014 the notion that America will soon become a \u201cmajority minority\u201d country, with people of color outnumbering whites \u2014 not only cause increased hostility toward other racial groups (which might be expected) but also push white people in a conservative direction on seemingly unrelated policy questions like tax rates and oil drilling. \n\nShe also makes the point that the majority-minority narrative is bogus. By the time it is forecast to happen, who-knows-what demographic changes will have taken place, including changes in who gets coded as \u201cwhite.\u201d Since the idea is wrong and it freaks people out, she reasons, we should probably stop uncritically repeating it.\n\nStill, what recent political evidence seems to show \u2014 and my Twitter brouhaha reflects in some small way \u2014 is that the effects Richeson found kick in well before news of any demographic apocalypse arrives (if you consider being a plurality rather than a majority apocalyptic).\n\nIndeed, as research on \u201cpriming\u201d shows, simply discussing race at all kicks up those effects among the racially dominant group. Or to put it more bluntly, in the US context: White people really don\u2019t like being called white people. They don\u2019t like being reminded that they are white people, part of a group with discernible boundaries, shared interests, and shared responsibilities. \n\nAfter all, one of the benefits of being in the dominant demographic and cultural group is that you are allowed to simply be a person, a blank slate upon which you can write your own individual story. You have no baggage but what you choose.\n\nIn most situations in the US, a woman is a female person. Someone part of a racial minority is a black person or a Latino person, etc. Gay people. Trans people. Immigrant people. All these groups are [adjective] people, people with an asterisk, while a white, heterosexual male is simply a person, as generic as he chooses. His presence is taken for granted; it rarely occurs to anyone to question it. A white man in khakis and a polo shirt can walk into almost any milieu in the US and, even if he\u2019s greeted with hostility, be taken seriously. His legitimacy is assumed. \n\nThe power and privilege that come along with that \u2014 being the base model, a person with no asterisk \u2014 are invisible to many white men. Simply calling them \u201cwhite people,\u201d much less questioning the behavior or beliefs of white people, drags that power and privilege into the open.\n\n        Some white men have even been known to rise above their level of competence.\n\n        Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIdentity politics is something only white men have been allowed to avoid\n\n\u201cIdentity politics\u201d \u2014 dragging around the baggage of one\u2019s identity, being forced constantly to reckon with it, work around the stereotypes and discrimination it attracts, speak for it, represent it \u2014 is something that is forced on other groups, not something they choose. Do you think a young black man likes walking into a store knowing he\u2019s already carrying the weight of a million suspicions and expectations, that he has to behave perfectly lest he invoke them? He\u2019d probably like to be thinking about tax policy too, if he didn\u2019t have to worry about getting shot by the cops on his way home. But that worry comes with his identity.\n\nWhite men bridle at the notion of being part of a tribe or engaging in identity politics. (Ahem.) Alone among social groups, they are allowed the illusion that they have only their own bespoke identity, that they are pure freethinkers, citizens, unburdened and uninfluenced by collective baggage (unique and precious \u201csnowflakes,\u201d if you will). \n\nNo one else is allowed to think that \u2014 at least not for long, before they are reminded again that they are, in the eyes of their country, little more than their identity, their asterisk. No one else gets to pretend their politics are free of identity.\n\nWhite people do. But simply saying the words \u201cwhite people\u201d is a direct attack on that illusion. It identifies, i.e., creates (or rather, exposes) an identity, a group with shared characteristics and interests. It raises questions (and doubts) about the group\u2019s standing and power relative to other groups. It illuminates all that hidden baggage. Lots of white people really hate that.\n\nIn politics, we talk about groups all the time \u2014 minorities, immigrants, criminals, what have you \u2014 and by and large, no one blinks. The only time I get blowback is when I generalize about men or white people (okay, or baby boomers). Suddenly, \u201clumping people together\u201d becomes a sin. Even among white liberal friends, I\u2019ve noticed that merely saying the words \u201cwhite people\u201d causes a frisson of discomfort. \n\nIn fact, it\u2019s difficult to think of a US setting in which the words \u201cwhite people\u201d are received neutrally. The term is always charged somehow, freighted with meaning and potential conflict, vaguely subversive. White people. White people. White people.\n\n        Shutterstock\n\nA shrinking group cannot avoid being reminded it is a group\n\nWhat primes white people is simply the reminder that they are white people \u2014 that they are, and will increasingly be, one group of Americans among others, with particular interests, settling differences via democracy. \n\nRight now, the white maleocracy is clinging to power, with disproportionate wealth and representation in Congress relative to its size. And all the while its leaders decry identity politics. They are used to being the default setting, people with no asterisks, no baggage, and they are extremely loath to give that up. \n\nIn fact, they want their America, the America where white dominance is so ubiquitous as to be unremarkable, back. They keep saying so. \n\nAs many have pointed out and this political era has made painfully clear, to a dominant demographic, the loss of privilege feels like persecution. Being just one group among many feels like losing. After all, what good is being white in the US, especially among poor whites, if some third-generation Ugandan immigrant has just as much control over their fate as they have over hers? If a poll asks whether they\u2019re any good for her, rather than the other way around?\n\nFor the dominant group, being judged and asked to justify itself, as so many subaltern groups are judged and asked to justify themselves, feels like an insult. If you doubt that, go read this Twitter thread.\n",
