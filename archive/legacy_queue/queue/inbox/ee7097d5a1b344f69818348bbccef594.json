      "Title": "The most highlighter-worthy ideas from popular business books, according to time-pressed readers Quartz",
      "Selection": "If you\u2019re a voracious reader of new business titles, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve heard of Blinkist, the app that sells condensed versions of top-selling books.\n\nThe Berlin-based startup wants to solve what it calls the \u201cmodern reading problem,\u201d which is that no one has much time for reading anymore. The app\u2019s writers consume books on behalf of subscribers and reduce them to texts that take 15 minutes to zip through. The company hopes you\u2019ll call these executive summaries \u201cBlinks.\u201d\n\nIf that sounds gross to you, you\u2019re not alone. On the surface (Blinkist\u2019s native territory) the service sounds like yet another sign of our culture\u2019s demise. Facing short attention spans and a constant need for novelty, we\u2019re throwing in the proverbial towel, giving up on any act that stretches our ability to focus on a narrative or go deep. (\u201cAfter taking Blinkist for a spin, I think it may appeal less to a time-poor, avid reader than a sweating businessman, crouched in a golf course toilet, trying to quickly brush up on his knowledge of politics or astrophysics to impress his boss,\u201d Sian Cain writes in her review of the app for The Guardian.)\n\nSome argue that Blinkist and its competitors, like Scribd\u2019s new Snapshots, can have a place in one\u2019s life if applied judiciously. They ought to be prohibited as stand-ins for literary work, goes the thinking, but may be acceptable shortcuts for mainlining non-fiction. Some books, meanwhile, really are meant to be information delivery systems, not experiences. In theory, that should make Blinkist perfect for books about careers and entrepreneurship, which are often fat with repetitive anecdotes, bullet-pointed material, and rehashed descriptions of social psychology or management studies.\n\nTo get a sense of what\u2019s resonating with US readers, who make up the bulk of the app\u2019s 10 million subscribers, we asked Blinkist to share the most frequently highlighted passages in its career and entrepreneurship categories over the past year.\n\nThe results do seem to capture certain preoccupations in our work lives: namely a desire for grounded-ness, presence, and balance. Readers were very taken, for instance, with Blinkist\u2019s paraphrased definition of empathetic listening, from its summary of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Instructions for chilling out, distilled from Psyched Up: How the Science of Mental Preparation Can Help You Succeed (Portfolio, 2017) also ranks high on the list.\n\nTellingly, one of the top 10 passages on careering has nothing to do with achievement at work. It comes from Blinkist\u2019s summary of No Hard Feelings, a recently published book that calls for an end to emotional compartmentalization in the office. The favored line: \u201cIf your mood and life are coming to be dominated by work, then a good approach is to simply try to care a little less about your work, and a bit more about yourself.\u201d\n\nBelow are the full results, the best of the Blinks, so to speak. Do they accurately reflect the nuance or revolutionary spirit that helped make the books upon which they are based so popular?
