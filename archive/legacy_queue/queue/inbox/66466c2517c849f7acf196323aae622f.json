      "Selection": "Trump is uninformed, underprepared, and unclear \u2014 and this is is the result.\n\nThe blame in the Senate\u2019s health care omnishambles is attaching to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and understandably so \u2014 he wrote the bill, he designed the process, he owns the result. But the absence of President Donald Trump from the story is, itself, an important part of the tale.\n\nFor better and for worse, policy leadership in the modern era tends to come from the White House. Take the Affordable Care Act. Though the bill was written in Congress, President Obama and his staff were involved at every step of its construction \u2014 they set the policy vision, used the technical resources of the executive branch to work through trade-offs, were deeply involved in the legislative process, and led the communications effort on the bill\u2019s behalf.\n\nThe apex of this was the Blair House summit. As the bill was floundering, Obama invited congressional leadership from both parties to the Blair House to debate the legislation on live television for hours. Obama was trying to prove to congressional Democrats that they could win the argument on health care, that he could win the argument on health care, and that they should trust him and pass the bill. It really is worth watching a few minutes of Obama\u2019s performance in this, and contrasting it with Trump\u2019s role in the replacement effort:\n\nObama\u2019s performance was effective because it was, to Democrats, persuasive. Obama knew the details of the legislation, he knew the issue, and he knew how Democrats thought \u2014 and so he made arguments they believed, and persuaded them that even if the Affordable Care Act was a dangerous vote to take, it was still a vote worth taking.\n\nWhat happened publicly at the Blair House happened privately every day. Obama and his team were constantly working to sell wavering Democrats on the bill, to persuade them that the trade-offs made were the right ones, to convince them this was a historic opportunity to achieve the Democratic Party\u2019s 80-year dream of universal health care. It\u2019s no accident that Obama\u2019s health care address to a joint session of Congress ended by wrapping the bill in the legacy of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, and framing it as the \u201cgreat unfinished business of our society.\u201d\n\nThe campaign worked. In the Senate, Democrats had 60 votes, they needed 60 votes, and they got 60 votes.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was a heavy lift, and there are many who deserve credit for its passage \u2014 notably Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. But I don\u2019t know anyone involved in that effort who thinks it could\u2019ve been done without Obama and his White House.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s repeal-and-replace effort was also a heavy lift, and it\u2019s been done without the productive involvement of Trump and his White House \u2014 in fact, Trump often made the process considerably harder.\n\nThe core problem is Trump has no idea what he\u2019s talking about on health care and never bothered to learn. \u201cNobody knew health care could be so complicated,\u201d he famously, and absurdly, said. His inability to navigate its complexities meant he couldn\u2019t make persuasive arguments on behalf of the bills he supported, and he routinely made statements that undercut the legislative process and forced Republicans to defend the indefensible.\n\nTrump\u2019s post-election promise of \u201cinsurance for everybody\u201d with \u201cmuch lower deductibles\u201d set up a standard Republicans had no intention of ever meeting but kept having to answer for. At his occasional meetings with wavering members of Congress, he\u2019s made superficial political arguments to people who had deep policy concerns. The discussions left legislators feeling insulted and annoyed that the president hadn\u2019t bothered to do the barest amount of homework.\n\nBecause Trump doesn\u2019t understand the legislation or the trade-offs it made, he can\u2019t make persuasive arguments on its behalf in public or private, and so he mostly doesn\u2019t try. Trump and his team are not frequent presences in the public debate trying to sell the legislation they\u2019re so keen to sign. That\u2019s one reason the various bills routinely polled around 20 percent \u2014 without Trump using the bully pulpit to argue on behalf of the legislation, critics, terrible Congressional Budget Office reports, and news of congressional infighting filled the void.\n\nWhen Trump does weigh in, it\u2019s often a disaster. Asked by Fox News\u2019s Tucker Carlson how he responded to analyses showing the House health bill would hurt the people who voted for him, he replied, \u201cOh, I know,\u201d and said the bill was \u201cvery preliminary.\u201d Later, after holding a Rose Garden ceremony to celebrate the passage of the House health bill, he called it \u201cmean.\u201d But he never articulated a standard for a bill that wouldn\u2019t be mean, and he never came up with a policy that wouldn\u2019t hurt his supporters.\n\nLater, during a particularly delicate moment in the Senate\u2019s negotiations, he tweeted that Senate Republicans should perhaps abandon the current process and \u201cimmediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!\u201d This tweet of no confidence didn\u2019t make McConnell\u2019s job any easier. At another point, Trump suggested it would be fine if Republicans failed to pass anything at all.\n\nIn this context, Trump\u2019s missive this morning is comical. No one has ever heard Trump discuss, with any specifics, how good the Senate health care bill is. No one believes he can, or that it would be a good idea if he tried.\n\nThe Republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is, & it will get even better at lunchtime.The Dems scream death as OCare dies!\n\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2017\n\nIn a prescient post-election piece for the conservative Weekly Standard, Yuval Levin and Gerard Alexander worried that Trump\u2019s disinterest in policy would lead to chaos in the legislative process:\n\nIn the absence of an opinionated final arbiter who could always be brought in, the policy process can easily become far less, rather than more, productive. If President Trump is indeed to remain above the details, and if the executive branch is unlikely to be able to compensate for his relative apathy or absence, congressional leaders may have to think very differently about their own role in the policy process. That might make for some opportunities, but only if members of Congress are prepared for what to many of them will be an unfamiliar and challenging task.\n\nMembers of Congress, we now see, were not prepared for that task. McConnell is a legislative tactician. He might be the guy you want to pass your health care bill. But he\u2019s not the guy you want to write your health care bill, decide its contours, make its policy trade-offs, and argue its merits.\n\nBy making McConnell that guy through his own inattention and ignorance, Trump set up the process for failure. The result was legislation nobody liked, that nobody could defend, and that looks likely to fail. And failure is, it\u2019s worth saying, a better outcome for the GOP and the country: The legislation is so poorly built, and sold on so many lies, that if it did pass, implementation would be a catastrophe.\n\nDuring the campaign, Trump posed as a master dealmaker. But you can\u2019t make a deal if you don\u2019t understand what\u2019s being discussed, what the various sides want, or what the trade-offs involved in different concessions would mean. And you really can\u2019t make a deal if you don\u2019t know what you want or why you want it. Preparation, information, and clarity matter in policymaking, and the widely acknowledged reality that Trump is completely underprepared, woefully uninformed, and personally confused mattered here.",
