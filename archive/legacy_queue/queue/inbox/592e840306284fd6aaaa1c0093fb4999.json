      "Selection": "Last year, US customs officers seized over $4 million worth of fake chairs. It was the first year that the agency had ever seized containers-full of such unauthorized reproductions, thanks in part to a novel new training that\u2019s turning port inspectors into design connoisseurs.\n\nOver the past 18 months, a five-year-old consortium of furniture manufacturers and design firms called BeOriginal Americas has been training US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers to distinguish real Eames, Starck, and Mies van der Rohe designs from fakes, among others. It\u2019s working: According to CBP\u2019s Intellectual Property Rights Seizure Statistics report (pdf, p.5), in 2016, customs officials confiscated 42 shipments of unauthorized replicas worth an estimated $4.2 million. In the same report, the CBP claimed that their \u201cfurniture enforcement efforts have helped to protect over 8,000 American jobs\u201d a figure calculated according to workforce data provided to them by US furniture manufacturers.\n\nBuyer beware. (Kartell, Herman Miller, Fritz Hansen, Knoll, Carl Hansen & S\u00f8n / Graphic by Quartz)\nBut they\u2019re up against a vast knock-off industry. Labeled with nice-sounding terms like \u201creproduction,\u201dreplica,\u201d or \u201chomage,\u201d many designer chairs in offices, hotel lobbies, airports, restaurants and even big furniture stores are actually unauthorized copies. And while a knock-off Eames or Barcelona chair might seem like a harmless, budget-friendly addition to your living room, these illegal knockoffs threaten the economy and the environment, and erode the very meaning of design.\n\nImitating Eames\n\nThe iconic Eames lounge chair is among the most copied pieces of furniture. Designed by husband-and-wife team Charles and Ray Eames for the luxury furniture market, the leather and bent plywood recliner has become symbolic of good design taste and affluence. The recliner was originally conceived as a napping-and-reading perch for Hollywood director Billy Wilder, who wanted a handsome English club chair with the feel of \u201cwarm, receptive look of a well-worn first baseman\u2019s mitt.\u201d\n\nToday, the Eames lounge is still assembled by hand in a Zeeland, Michigan factory following the same meticulous process that the Eameses took four years to perfect. The mid-century modern classic often appears on celebrity photographs, TV shows, magazine covers, and enshrined in MoMA\u2019s permanent collection.\n\nIt was a sensation from the moment it was unveiled it on live television in 1956. But not everyone watching the Arlene Francis Home show could afford to shell out $310 (around $2,800 today). Inevitably, knockoffs surfaced in the market.\n\nBy 1962, imitations were so widespread the Eames took out a full page ad warning customers about fakes. The ad on the back cover of Arts and Architecture magazine instructed buyers to look for Herman Miller\u2019s logo, the only authorized manufacturer of their chairs at the time. (Swiss manufacturer Vitra makes Eames furniture for the European and Middle Eastern market today.)\n\n\u201cBeware of Imitations\u201d Full page ad by the Eames Office for the back cover of Arts and Architecture magazine, 1962. (Eames Office/Herman Miller)\nToday, e-commerce has made the job of policing fakes much harder. A quick search online yields hundreds of options, from Amazon, Ebay, Alibaba and various online retailers around the world. Brick-and-mortar shop Manhattan Home Design in New York City touts knockoffs that, according to one sales rep, \u201cmatch or exceed the licensed product,\u201d and even offers an instructional video on how to judge a good knockoff from a bad one. As with fake Rolex watches, there\u2019s deep connoisseurship in the fakes business. Manhattan Home Design did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\n Steve Jobs and Bill Gates sitting on an #Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman while brainstorming the next big idea. #EamesLoungeChair #SteveJobs #BillGates #tbt\n\nA post shared by Charles & Ray Eames (@eamesoffice) on Jun 4, 2015 at 10:08am PDT\n\nIn the end, it all boils down to bargains. For just a fraction of the original Eames chair\u2019s $5,000 price, customers can get the look. On Amazon, Eames knockoffs sell for as low as $749\u2014that\u2019s even cheaper than Vitra\u2019s licensed 6-inch toy version of the Eames lounge and ottoman, which costs $795.\n\nProtecting precious designs\n\nProtecting intellectual property isn\u2019t easy for furniture designers. For one thing, the bar is high: IP laws for furniture in the US don\u2019t protect function, so designers have to prove a unique element in their design to qualify for a patent. Even if you get a patent, patent protections that apply in one region rarely apply elsewhere\u2014not very useful in a global marketplace. Even members of the EU can\u2019t agree on a standard duration on design patents.\n\nIn the US, the Eames lounge chair and other iconic designs are protected by what\u2019s called \u201ctrade dress\u201d rights. \u201cTrade dress protects furniture designs that have come to be associated by consumers with a single source,\u201d explains intellectual property attorney Michael J. McCue. The law protects the \u201ccommercial look\u201d of well-known designs such as the Eames lounge chair or the Coca-Cola bottle for perpetuity, even when design patents have elapsed.\n\nFew companies are above copying another\u2019s designs. In 2012, the upscale US furniture company Restoration Hardware, which has something of a reputation for borrowing designs, advertised a metal chair called the \u201cNaval\u201d chair, identical to Pennsylvania-based chair maker Emeco\u2019s well-known \u201cNavy\u201d chair.\n\nA lightweight and virtually indestructible model made of recycled aluminum, Emeco\u2019s chair was originally engineered for the US Navy during World War II. Later, the rugged chair (aka Emeco 1006) became a popular choice for police station interrogation rooms, prisons, and hospitals because of its reputation for toughness.\n\nEmeco\u2019s 20-06 chair vs. IKEA\u2019s Melltorp dining chair (Emeco / IKEA)\nIt takes 77 steps over 10 days to produce one Emeco Navy chair, with craftsmen moulding, welding and finishing it by hand in Hanover, Pennsylvania. The result is a $455 chair with a lifetime warranty. Made in China, Restoration Hardware\u2019s heavier version costs just $129.\n\n\u201cThe last thing I want to do is to spend our money in litigation,\u201d says Emeco CEO Gregg Buchbinder. \u201cBut if you fail to react to something that grievous, you end up losing ownership within a short amount of time.\u201d\n\nThat year, Buchbinder successfully sued to stop Restoration Hardware\u2019s copies from spreading in the market. Last year, he also successfully sued to stop IKEA from mass producing copies of a Norman Foster-designed Emeco chair.\n\nNavy chair vs. Naval chair (Emeco / Restoration Hardware)\nWhat\u2019s wrong with knockoffs?\n\nCompanies who rip off classics benefit because they can skip the years-long product development phase and often have an easier time selling their versions because consumers are already familiar with the look. Large furniture companies like Ikea and Restoration Hardware, which mail millions of catalogues each season, can also disseminate far more information about a design than the original creator, adds Buchbinder. \u201cThe average consumer would think that\u2019s the original chair.\u201d\n\nA little bit of copying can actually spur innovation, argue law professors Kal Raustiala and Christopher Jon Sprigman in the book Knockoff Economy. \u201cImitation only makes the fashion cycle run faster and forces the fashion industry to be ever more creative,\u201d they write of clothes knock-offs. \u201cWhen an original becomes a knockoff, it\u2019s a signal to move on to the next big thing.\u201d\u00a0To appreciate the difference between an original and a knockoff is to understand the difference between design and style.\u00a0\n\nOthers argue that knockoffs can serve the original designer. Through what\u2019s called the \u201cpiracy paradox,\u201d copycats often help spread a designer\u2019s work and increase the demand for it.\n\nBut good furniture designers are interested in durability, not novelty.\u201cBuilt to last,\u201d \u201ctimeless\u201d and \u201cheirloom\u201d are the trade\u2019s virtues. Charles\u2019s grandson Eames Demetrios says that arguing for authenticity is difficult in a time when most consumers have little experience of making products by hand. \u201cMost people when they think of the word \u2018copy,\u2019 they think of dragging a file from one side of a [computer] desktop to another,\u201d observes Demetrios. \u201cThat makes us hard to have a conversation because at some level we have this feeling that a copy is the same thing.\u201d\n\nRichard Donges and Charles Eames at the Herman Miller factory. (Eames Office)\nThere are practical considerations too. Buying knockoffs also exposes consumers and companies to safety risks, warns Coleman Gutshall, Bernhardt Design\u2019s director of global strategy and sourcing. Without a reputation to protect, counterfeiters can skirt product safety regulations or employ factories with questionable labor policies. Quantum, an ergonomic office chair sold by Office Depot that looks suspiciously like Herman Miller\u2019s Aeron chair was found to have defective backrest bolts and caused back injuries.\n\nAeron chair look-a-like Quantum was recalled in 2009. (U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission)\nThe difference between design and style\n\n\u201cCopying something without consideration of quality is now an epidemic,\u201d once said architect Benjamin Cherner to Dwell. \u201cThe world has been flooded with \u2018stage props\u2019\u2014items that resemble useful objects but have minimal functionality.\u201d\n\nBuchbinder blames knock-off culture on a popular misconception of what \u201cdesign\u201d really means. \u201cThe design of the chair really starts with scientists, chemists and engineers working on the materials and the processes,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more to design other than the shape. I don\u2019t think the average consumer understands that, they think they\u2019re paying for the shape.\u201d\n\nDesigner chairs are often advertised based on form, finish and material. But like all good design, furniture design is primarily concerned with looking for solutions for specific needs. Well-built office chairs, for instance, are engineered so they don\u2019t tip over when the sitter leans back; the superdurable Navy chair emerged from the US military\u2019s need for a deckchair that could \u201cwithstand water, salt air and sailors\u201d; and the Eames lounge chair is obsessively designed for comfort. Knockoffs, while styled similarly, can fail to deliver solutions because counterfeiters are focused on mass producing and selling good-enough products cheaply and quickly. \u201cIn the end, a fake is designed for one thing: to be cheaper,\u201d observes Demetrios.\n\nThere are indeed some very good knockoffs. But the energy spent aping another\u2019s design would be better spent on creating an original design that responds to a new problem. Good design is never just about form. To appreciate the difference between an original and a knockoff is to understand the difference between design and style.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article stated that the global counterfeit furniture industry had been estimated at $1.7 trillion. That figure is actually an outdated projection of the \u201ceconomic and social impacts\u201d of all counterfeit and pirated goods by 2015, according to the International Chamber of Commerce. It has been removed from the article, and the headline has been changed accordingly. ",
