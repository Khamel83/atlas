      "Selection": "After British Airways\u00a0devalued its program to eliminate 4,500-mile short-haul flights in the US, many US-based travelers wrote off the Avios program. There are still plenty of frustrations with the program \u2014\u00a0from fuel surcharges on British Airways-operated flights to connecting flights pricing separately. However, there have been a few nice changes recently that open an incredible sweet spot.\n\nLast year, American Airlines changed its domestic first-class coding from F (first class) to J (business class). This changed nothing for AAdvantage awards, but this change halved the price of American Airlines-operated flights when using Avios. Last week, American Express improved the standard transfer rate from Membership Rewards to Avios to 1:1. If that wasn\u2019t good enough, Amex and BA just launched a 40% transfer bonus.\n\nNow, you\u2019ll get 75% more Avios when transferring Membership Rewards than you would if you transferred them a week ago, and American Airlines domestic first-class flights are 50% less than a year ago. That means your Membership Rewards take you 3.5x further on AA domestic first-class flights than just nine months ago! The same sub-1,151 mile nonstop domestic first-class flight that would\u2019ve required 37,500 Membership Rewards a year ago now costs just 10,750 points today \u2014 that means you can book several round-trips with the sign-up bonuses available with\u00a0The Platinum Card from American Express\u00a0or\u00a0The Business Platinum Card from American Express OPEN.\n\nHow about celebrating by flying in a lie-flat business-class product? While American has a frustratingly inconsistent fleet, it also has some of the best business-class seats in the skies on some aircraft. And, some of these are flown domestically on a somewhat consistent schedule. Now, with the transfer bonus running through September 17, you can try out one of these products for just 15,000 Avios \u2014\u00a0which you can get for just 10,750 transferred Membership Rewards (as transfers must be in increments of 250 points).\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the routes you can do this on.\n\nIn This Post\n\nBoeing 777-200\n\nKatie and I enjoying dinner on a flight from DFW to MIA on the 777-200.\nAmerican Airlines\u2019 777-200 is so complicated that it takes an entire article to explain it. However, there are essentially just two business-class seat options. Both are lie-flat, but one is significantly more spacious and stable than the other. However, either one would be a huge improvement from standard domestic first-class products you\u2019d find on other AAircraft.\n\nFrom\n\nTo\n\nFlight #\n\nDepart\n\nArrival\n\nStarting\n\nEnding\n\nFrequ\n\nency\n\nDFW\n\nMIA\n\n905\n\n17:00\n\n20:55\n\nnow\n\nAug-3\n\nDaily\n\nMIA\n\nDFW\n\n61\n\n9:10\n\n11:11\n\nnow\n\nAug-21\n\nDaily\n\nDFW\n\nMIA\n\n905\n\n17:00\n\n20:56\n\nAug-4\n\nAug-21\n\nDaily\n\nDFW\n\nMIA\n\n2307\n\n10:25\n\n14:10\n\nAug-22\n\nAug-22\n\nOne-Off\n\nDFW\n\nMIA\n\n905\n\n16:55\n\n20:43\n\nAug-22\n\nAug-31*\n\nDaily\n\nMIA\n\nDFW\n\n61\n\n9:10\n\n11:14\n\nAug-22\n\nAug-31*\n\nDaily\n\nJFK\n\nMIA\n\n235\n\n17:00\n\n20:12\n\nAug-22\n\nAug-22\n\nOne-Off\n\nDFW\n\nORD\n\n2332\n\n7:55\n\n10:11\n\nnow\n\nAug-20\n\nSunday\n\nORD\n\nDFW\n\n2334\n\n11:45\n\n13:59\n\nnow\n\nAug-20\n\nSunday\n\nDFW\n\nORD\n\n2400\n\n22:15\n\n0:27\n\nAug-3\n\nAug-3\n\nOne-Off\n\n*Likely extends beyond August 31.

While the business-class cabin is being retained as is, the Envoy seats are a solid mid-tier and they lie flat. While there aren\u2019t many domestic A330 flights, there\u2019s one reliable one:\n\nFrom\n\nTo\n\nFlight #\n\nDepart\n\nArrival\n\nStarting\n\nEnding\n\nFrequency\n\nPHL\n\nCLT\n\n600\n\n7:00\n\n8:36\n\nnow\n\n1-Aug-17\n\nDaily\n\nPHL\n\nCLT\n\n600\n\n7:00\n\n8:36\n\n4-Aug-17\n\n21-Aug-17\n\nDaily\n\nBut What About Award Availability?\n\nAmerican Airlines has become known for having AAtrocious AAward AAvailability recently, but I\u2019m finding a decent amount of award availability of some of these flights. The availability is helped by the sheer number of business-class seats on these aircraft (some have 45). Remember to use the best techniques when searching\u00a0to save yourself time and hassle.\n\nHere\u2019s one 777-200 flight from Dallas/Forth Worth (DFW) to Miami (MIA) with seven business-class award seats available. Even better, a hot dinner is served on this flight.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile it\u2019s a lot more fun to fly these lie-flat business-class products overseas, it\u2019s also nice to try them out on domestic routes. In addition to the extra space, I\u2019ve found the catering to generally be better on these internationally configured aircraft. If you\u2019re flying between one of the cities below, check to see if you can try out one of these aircraft for yourself using less than 11,000 Membership Rewards.\n",
