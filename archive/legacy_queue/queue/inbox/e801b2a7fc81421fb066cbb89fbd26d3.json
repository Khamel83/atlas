      "Selection": "Thanks to the Marriott Starwood merger, it is now possible to link your Marriott Rewards and SPG (Starwood Preferred Guest) accounts.\u00a0 By linking accounts you can now do the following:\n\nMatch Status: Marriott Gold matches to SPG Gold; Marriott Platinum matches to SPG Platinum\n\nTransfer Points: Points transfer in either direction. 3 Marriott Rewards points = 1 SPG Starpoint\n\nMarriott Rewards and SPG each have unique program sweet spots and partnerships.\u00a0 As a result, this merger has opened up some really sweet opportunities.\u00a0 This post serves as a complete overview to these opportunities.\u00a0 I\u2019ll add to the post as more sweet spots are discovered.\u00a0 I\u2019ll also follow up with in-depth coverage of some of these sweet spots (and I\u2019ll update this post to link out to those).\n\nTo learn pretty much everything you need to know about the merger and how it affects the two loyalty programs, Marriott has put together an excellent FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) site, found here: http://ift.tt/2cMYTkH.\n\nSweet Opportunities: Point Earnings\n\nEarn more SPG points per dollar at Marriott properties.\u00a0 With the exception of Residence Inns and Towneplace Suites, stays at Marriott properties earn 10 points per dollar for general members, 12.5 points per dollar for Gold elites, and 15 points per dollar for Platinum elites.\u00a0 If you then convert those points 3 to 1, it translates to the following earning rates:\n\nGeneral Members: 3.33 SPG Starpoints per dollar (vs. 2 Starpoints per dollar at Starwood properties)\n\nGold Members: 4.17 SPG Starpoints per dollar (vs. 3 Starpoints per dollar at Starwood properties)\n\nPlatinum Members: 5 SPG Starpoints per dollar (vs. 3 to 4 Starpoints per dollar depending on your Platinum status level)\n\nEarn more Marriott points per dollar with the SPG credit card. The Amex SPG credit card offers 1 point per dollar for most spend and 2 points per dollar at Starwood properties.\u00a0 This translates to 3 Marriott points per dollar for most spend and 6 Marriott points per dollar at Starwood properties.\u00a0 This is much better than Marriott branded cards that earn 5X at Marriott, 2X for airline, car rental, & restaurants, and 1X elsewhere.\n\nConvert the Amex SPG signup bonus into 75,000 Marriott Rewards points.\u00a0 Skip the stinky new 2 free night offer and go for the good old 25K signup bonus offer instead.\n\nEarn 3X Marriott points with SPG partners. Delta, Emirates, Caesars Entertainment, Design Hotels, Uber, and Audience Rewards all offer opportunities to earn Starpoints.\u00a0 Now, you can indirectly earn 3X Marriott points.\u00a0 You can find details of these partnerships here.\n\nEarn 1/3X SPG points with Marriott partners.\u00a0 Obviously this is less compelling than going the other way around, but there may be some opportunities worth pursuing.\u00a0 Find Marriott point earning partnerships here.\n\nAdditional options for earning SPG points which now convert 1 to 3 to Marriott Rewards, can be found here: Top 10 shortcuts to earning SPG points.\n\nSweet Opportunities: Free Nights\n\nConvert SPG points to Marriott to book free nights for 24% more value: Hotel Hustle shows median point redemption values for most hotel chains.\u00a0 At the time of this writing, the median point value (in cents per point) for SPG is 1.849 and Marriott is 0.763.\u00a0 This means that, on average, you can get more value per SPG point by converting to Marriott 1 to 3.\u00a0 By doing so, each SPG point, on average, should yield 0.763 x 3 = 2.289 cents per point value.\u00a0 That\u2019s a 24% increase in value over using SPG points to book SPG hotels!\u00a0 Of course, this is just based on median results \u2014 your specific results will vary.\n\nBook Marriott hotels for 2000 to 15,000 SPG points per night.\u00a0 Marriott\u2019s free night award chart ranges from 6,000 to 45,000 points per night.\u00a0 With the SPG to Marriott 1 to 3 conversion ratio, that means that SPG points go really far when booking Marriott stays.\n\nBook Ritz Carlton hotels for 10,00 to 23,333 SPG points per night.\u00a0 Again, SPG points represent a great value for booking Ritz properties.\n\nBook low category SPG properties for 6,000 to 12,000 Marriott points per night: SPG category 1 and 2 properties range in award price from 2,000 to 4,000 SPG points per night.\u00a0 That translates to only 6,000 to 12,000 Marriott points per night.\n\nBook SPG Points & Cash nights, up to Category 5 for 18,000 (or fewer) Marriott points per night (plus cash)\n\nBook SPG Points & Cash upgraded rooms, up to Category 5 for 21,750 (or fewer) Marriott points per night (plus cash)\n\nBook SPG Points & Cash suites, up to Category 5 for 36,000 (or fewer) Marriott points per night (plus cash)\n\nSweet Opportunities: Nights & Flights\n\nBoth Marriott and SPG offer travel packages in which you can redeem hotel points for 5 or 7 night hotel stays plus get airline miles as well.\u00a0 The airline miles go to your airline loyalty account and do not have to be used for the same trip in which you book your stay.\n\nFor background, please see:\n\nSPG Nights & Flights vs. Marriott Travel Packages\n\nAnalysis of Marriott Travel Packages: 5 Night vs. 7 Night\n\nThese travel packages lead to the following sweet opportunities:\n\nGet 5 nights at a category 5 Marriott property plus 132,000 United MileagePlus miles for 79,000 SPG points*\n\nGet 5 nights at a category 5 Marriott property plus 120,000 air miles for 79,000 SPG points*\n\nGet 7 nights at a category 5 Marriott property plus 132,000 United MileagePlus miles for 90,000 SPG points\n\nGet 7 nights at a category 5 Marriott property plus 120,000 air miles for 90,000 SPG points\n\nGet 5 nights at an SPG category 3 property plus 50,000 air miles for 180,000 Marriott points\n\nGet 5 nights at an SPG category 4 property plus 50,000 air miles for 210,000 Marriott points\n\n* Note that Marriott 5 Night travel packages exist, but they\u2019re intended to be only available to Marriott Vacation Club (timeshare) owners.\u00a0 In some cases, Marriott elite members have been able to book these packages without being Vacation Club owners.\u00a0 More details can be found here: Marriott 5 Night Travel Packages exist, but they\u2019re secret.\n\nSweet Opportunities: Transfer to Miles\n\nSPG has a huge list of transfer partners (found here) and most transfer at a very favorable rate: 20,000 SPG Starpoints = 25,000 air miles.\u00a0 But, SPG does not transfer to Southwest Airlines, and the transfer ratio to United is poor (2 to 1).\n\nWhen SPG to Marriott to Miles is a good idea\u2026\n\nMarriott points transfer to many airlines as well, but transfer ratios vary by the number of points transferred, whether or not you use a travel package to transfer, and the specific airline you transfer to.\u00a0 I\u2019ll cover these intricacies in a future post.\u00a0 For now, consider converting SPG points to Marriott and then to miles as follows (note that you can often do better than SPG\u2019s usual 1 to 1.25 ratio!):\n\nConvert SPG to United at a great ratio!\n\n5 Night Category 1-5 Travel Package: 79,000 SPG =\u00a0 more than 235,000 Marriott = 132,000 United miles (1 to 1.67)\n\n7 Night Category 1-5 Travel Package: 90,000 SPG = 270,000 Marriott = 132,000 miles (1 to 1.47)\n\nDirect conversion: 19,000 SPG = more than 56,000 Marriott points = 25,000 miles (1 to 1.31)\n\nConvert to many other airlines* at a ratio of 1 to 1.33 or better:\n\n5 Night Category 1-5 Travel Package: 79,000 SPG =\u00a0 more than 235,000 Marriott = 120,000 miles (1 to 1.52)\n\n7 Night Category 1-5 Travel Package: 90,000 SPG = 270,000 Marriott = 120,000 miles (1 to 1.33)\n\nDirect conversion: 24,000 SPG = more than 70,000 Marriott points = 25,000 miles (1 to 1.04)Direct conversion is not recommended here except where SPG does not directly support the same partner such as with Southwest.\n\n* \u201cMany other airlines\u201d = Aeromexico, Aeroplan (Air Canada), Alaska, American Airlines, British Airways, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, GOL/Varig, Hawaiian Airlines, Iberia Airlines, Southwest, Virgin Atlantic\n\nAs you can see above, you can now indirectly convert SPG points to United miles at a terrific ratio. Plus, you get a free Marriott stay as well! This indirect technique also makes Southwest available at a very good transfer ratio.\u00a0 Even airlines that are usually good options for SPG transfers are better with Marriott Travel Packages.\u00a0 These include: Aeroplan, Alaska, American Airlines, British Airways, and Delta.\n\nQuick Tips Regarding Marriott Travel Packages:\n\nIf you really don\u2019t want that free stay, you can return the certificate and they\u2019ll give you some of your points back! \u00a0That makes the conversion to miles ratios even better! \u00a0Unfortunately, I don\u2019t know how much is returned for each travel package. I\u2019ll update this when I get that information.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure which exact hotel you will stay in, always buy the Cat 1-5 package because it is the cheapest, and always go for the most miles possible within that category. \u00a0You can always pay\u00a0additional Marriott points when it\u2019s time to actually book your stay, if you want to stay in a higher category hotel.\n\nWhen Marriott to SPG to miles is a good idea\u2026\n\nWith select airlines, Marriott conversions to miles are much worse than shown above.\u00a0 So, if you need miles with these airlines, you\u2019d be better off transferring from SPG.\u00a0 60,000 Marriott points = 20,000 SPG = 25,000 air miles.\u00a0 In other words, you\u2019ll get a 2.4 to 1 Marriott to miles conversion ratio with these airlines:\n\nVirgin America, Airberlin,\u00a0Air China, Air France/KLM, Alitalia,\u00a0ANA, Asiana Airlines, Avianca-TACA,\u00a0China Eastern,\u00a0China Southern, Emirates,\u00a0 Etihad Airways,\u00a0Japan Airlines,\u00a0Korean Air, LAN, Lufthansa Miles & More, Qatar Airways,\u00a0Saudia Airlines, Singapore Airlines\n\nSweet Opportunities: Hotel Elite Status\n\nAmex Platinum card = SPG Gold = Marriott Gold = Free breakfast or lounge access at most Marriott properties\n\nSPG card spend $30K = SPG Gold = Marriott Gold = Free breakfast or lounge access at most Marriott properties\n\nUnited MileagePlus Gold status or higher = Marriott Gold\u00a0(via RewardsPlus) = SPG Gold\n\nRitz card = Marriott Gold = SPG Gold\n\nRitz card spend $75K = Marriott Platinum = SPG Platinum\n\nSPG Gold = Marriott Gold = Marriott Taste of Platinum Challenge = SPG Platinum (I\u2019ll explain in a future post)\n\nSweet Opportunities: Airline Elite Status (and Companion Pass)\n\nSPG Platinum = Marriott Platinum = United Silver Elite (via RewardsPlus)\n\nMarriott Gold = SPG Gold = Delta elite privileges and bonus Starpoints on Delta flights (via Crossover Rewards)\n\n90,000 SPG Starpoints = 270,000 Marriott = 7 Nights + 120,000 Southwest points = Southwest Companion pass (Important: Wait until beginning of calendar year to do this!)\n\nSweet Opportunities: Weird Point Conversion Options\n\nConvert Amex Membership Rewards to Marriott 1 to 1, or better\n\nUsual: 3000 Membership Rewards = 1000 SPG = 3000\n\nWith occasional 50% transfer bonus: 3000 Membership Rewards = 1500 SPG = 4500 Marriott\n\nConvert Ultimate Rewards to SPG\n\n1000 Ultimate Rewards = 1000 Marriott = 333 SPG\n\nConvert Diners Club to Marriott at better than usual rate\n\nUsual: 1250 Diners Club = 1500 Marriott\n\nVia SPG: 1250 Diners Club = 750 SPG = 2,250 Marriott\n\nSweet Opportunities: Buy Points for Less\n\nI don\u2019t usually recommend buying points directly from any loyalty program, but at times it can make sense.\u00a0 Standard prices are:\n\nMarriott: $12.50 per 1000 (1.25 cents per point)\n\nSPG: $17.50 per 500 (3.5 cents per point)\n\nYou can now indirectly buy Marriott points via SPG:\n\n$17.50 = 500 SPG = 1500 Marriott = 1.17 cents per point\n\nEven with the standard price for SPG points, it is a little bit cheaper to buy Marriott points this way.\u00a0 However, SPG frequently runs deals where points are 25% to 35% off.\u00a0 In those cases it will be much cheaper to buy Marriott points indirectly through SPG.\n\nSweet Opportunities: Transferring Points to Others\n\nBoth SPG and Marriott allow points to be transferred for free to a spouse or domestic partner.\u00a0 SPG goes further and allows free point transfers to anyone in the same household.\u00a0 So, it should be possible to transfer Marriott points to another member of the household who is not your spouse or domestic partner as follows:\n\nHousehold Member 1: Convert Marriott points to SPG\n\nHousehold Member 1: Transfer SPG points to household member 2\n\nHousehold Member 2: Convert SPG points to Marriott points\n\nThis may also get around point purchase limits in place with each chain (30K per year SPG, 50K per year Marriott).\n\nReader Suggestions?\n\nWhich sweet opportunities did I miss?\u00a0 I\u2019d like to try to keep this post up to date.\u00a0 Please comment below\n\nEarn miles without flying\u2014> Start Here\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe post Marriott SPG Complete Guide to Sweet Opportunities appeared first on Frequent Miler.",
