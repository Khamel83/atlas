      "Selection": "The March Bon Appetit\u2019s \u201cDinner Tonight\u201d column features a spread of recipes by chef Alex Raij. As the owner of four restaurants and mother of two, Alex says her secret to getting dinner on the table is improvisation\u2014grabbing this and grabbing that, working with what she has on hand. She also reveals her secret for succulent chicken thighs: \u201cHumble mayonnaise, which encourages browning.\u201d\n\nI see minimal prep in your future...\nPhoto\u00a0by Alexandra Stafford\n\nHaving had success with mayonnaise in surprising applications in the past\u2014Gabrielle Hamilton\u2019s genius grilled cheese and chocolate chicory cake, for instance\u2014I needed no more convincing to make Alex\u2019s mayonnaise-slicked chicken. The recipe at its core, moreover, looked simple: Toss potatoes with sliced onion, oil, and water in a roasting pan. Place bone-in, skin-on, mayonnaise-coated (and -marinated, if time permits) chicken thighs on top. Roast at 450\u00ba F until the chicken is lightly charred and cooked through.\n\nFor the amount of prep, which amounts to slicing an onion and stirring together two condiments, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever reaped such a great reward: exceptionally tender chicken and incredibly tasty potatoes flavored with the juices of the meat, the sweet, meltingly tender onions, and the olive oil. I\u2019ve made the dish several times now with a few modifications to account for the ingredients I\u2019ve had on hand and time limitations\u2014not once have I marinated this chicken, and not once has it received anything but rave reviews.\n\nFrom tarragon-y to oven ready...\nPhotos\u00a0by Alexandra Stafford\n\nThese are the keys to success here:\n\n1. Use smallish potatoes, ideally ones that require no chopping. Small fingerlings (or halved large ones) will work, as will new potatoes or whatever you can find at your market\u2014I\u2019ve been using honey golds. A small potato not only minimizes prep but also ensures it will cook completely through by the time the chicken is done.\n\n2. Monitor the water level: Depending on the size of your pan, you may need to add water to prevent the onions from getting too brown. See notes in the recipe.\n\n3. Finish with herbs: Nothing says spring like tarragon! A showering of fresh herbs\u2014chives, tarragon, parsley, or whatever you like best\u2014just before serving brightens this dish up both color- and flavor-wise.\n\nEffortless chic is a good look.\nPhoto\u00a0by Alexandra Stafford\n\nI know mayonnaise, for some people, can be a hard sell, but before the inclusion of this ingredient turns you away, first consider what mayonnaise is: an emulsion of oil and egg often with a little lemon or vinegar. It\u2019s harmless! If that\u2019s not enough, know that whatever it is about mayonnaise that offends you\u2014its smell, texture, appearance\u2014dissipates in the oven. And if that\u2019s not enough still, let the promise of a five-minute dinner prep show you the light\u2014the result, I have no doubt, will make mayonnaise a page turner in your book no longer.\n\nOne-Pan Roasted Chicken Thighs with Potatoes and Tarragon\n\nBy Alexandra Stafford\n\n1.5\npounds small potatoes, see notes above\n\n1\nmedium onion, thinly sliced, to yield about a cup\n\n2\ntablespoons olive oil\n\n1/2\ncup water\n\nkosher salt and fresh cracked pepper to taste\n\n1/4\ncup mayonnaise\n\n2\ntablespoons Dijon mustard\n\n4\nbone-in, skin-on chicken thighs\n\na few tablespoons finely chopped herbs, such as tarragon, chives, or parsley\n\nView Full Recipe",
