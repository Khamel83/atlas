(Don\u2019t we all?) I came to California seven years ago when most New Yorkers were still turning up their noses at this city. I had a local job \u2014 not a work-remote situation. I befriended my neighbors. I patronized burrito joints that were not endorsed by Anthony Bourdain. I got a public library card. I learned the bus routes near my house. I made sure to vote in local elections.\n\nImage via Rafa Esparza, who asks \u201cWhat can citizenship outside of colonization and more in tune with cultural stewardship look like?\u201d\n\nThis is the question for L.A.\u2019s economically privileged new arrivals: How do you help care for the city that drew you in, rather than allow your presence to steamroll its culture?\n\nAlso insert \u201cNew York\u201d and \u201cSan Francisco,\u201d above.\n\nTags: Ann Friedman\u00a0\u00a0 gentrification\u00a0\u00a0 Los Angeles",
