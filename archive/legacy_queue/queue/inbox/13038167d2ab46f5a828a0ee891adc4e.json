      "Selection": "Here is a common experience:\n\nYou get incredibly excited about a new business idea or project. Maybe you\u2019ve had it in the back of your head for a long time and\u00a0something finally clicked inside of you to start working on it. Or, maybe it\u2019s something you\u00a0just thought of and you want to get it up and running as soon as possible.\n\nAt work, in the car, and even in your sleep, thoughts about your new idea race through your brain. You\u2019re not only taking mental notes about the work you need to do but you\u2019re also imagining what it would be like when other people experience your idea and benefit from your creativity and hard work.\n\nYou go full throttle with your idea. You work hard, make sacrifices, and get stuff done. Progress is being made and it\u2019s incredibly exciting.\n\nThen, for some reason, the fire dies and the excitement goes away. Work that you were once totally jazzed about now seems like a chore. \u201cWhat\u2019s possible\u201d is replaced with \u201cwhat am I doing?\u201d and the progress begins to slow down and production eventually comes to a halt.\n\nYour idea just sits there, half-finished (more or less).\n\nSound familiar?\n\nIf this hasn\u2019t happened to you, you\u2019re one of the \u201clucky ones.\u201d But for most people this \u201ccrank then tank\u201d experience is all too common. Although I\u2019ve taken many of my ideas to launch, I have a slew of others that I\u2019ve started but never followed through with.\n\nHere\u2019s one in particular that I\u2019d like to dissect for you:\n\nStep-by-Step Images\n\nIn January 2011 I wrote\u00a0An Underrated Skill That All Bloggers Should Have and I Would Like To Teach. In it, I talk about how important graphic\u00a0creation and manipulation\u00a0skills\u00a0(i.e., Photoshop skills) have been for my online business\u2014to be able to quickly (and on my own) create or manipulate an image and use it right away as opposed to hiring someone and paying them to do it for me, which could take several days and a lot of back and forth.\n\nIt\u2019s the one skill that I learned while working in the architecture industry that I can easily apply to my online businesses, and I\u2019m in Photoshop almost every single day. It reduces stress and saves me a ton of time and money.\n\nThe post I wrote was meant to increase awareness of this valuable skill but also use it as a \u201cfeeler\u201d to see whether or not people would be interested in learning how to use Photoshop or software similar to Photoshop.\n\nIn short, there was a lot of interest.\n\nAs a result, in addition to a webinar, I had a big idea for a separate website that would include a number of graphic design tutorials that people could learn from.\n\nThere were, of course, a ton of existing resources, both paid and free, for how to use Photoshop and other software, but I wanted to take a slightly different approach. I wanted to create tutorials specifically for bloggers, Internet marketers, and anyone else who does business online.\n\nInstead of something like a course that takes you through all of the tools and helps you understand how Photoshop works, it would instead let you select from a library of tutorials for whatever specific kind of graphic you needed at that time. A banner ad, a Twitter background, a Facebook cover image\u2014you select the graphic you need and my tutorials would walk you through,\u00a0step-by-step,\u00a0how to create that specific graphic, some including templates to work off of to make things even easier.\n\nThat\u2019s when I started working on StepbyStepImages.com.\n\nFor three weeks I was so amped about my idea. I created mind maps, outlined tutorials, and built the website that you see on the deserted website linked above. I even learned how to install and use WP-Wishlist\u00a0to include members-only content.\n\nAfter three weeks I had created the perfect \u201cshell.\u201d It was sort of like a totally brand new house: empty, but ready to be furnished.\n\nThen, it was time to furnish the site and create all of the tutorials. That\u2019s when things started to slow down.\n\nA Change in Course\n\nIn total, I had mind-mapped about 60 different graphic design tutorials. For each, I wanted two versions: a version where I show how to create or edit the image in Photoshop, and then another version where I show how to create or edit the image in Gimp, a free online image editing software.\u00a0That\u2019s 120 different screen recordings.\n\nI started to screen record the first video and with edits, re-shoots, branding, and effects, it\u00a0took about 30 minutes to complete a high-quality 5-minute tutorial.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect it to take that long and I still had 119 more to go.\n\nThat\u2019s when things started to slow down. A lot. Something happened mentally and I just wasn\u2019t excited anymore. It was a feeling I almost had in an instant and my whole mindset about this project changed. I only created one more tutorial after that first one, and since then, nothing.\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nThis sort of thing happens to me every so often, although lately I\u2019ve been very good about completing big projects before moving on to the next. One example of this\u00a0is my podcasting tutorial, which took over 30 hours to complete.\n\nWith Step-by-Step Images, however, I just didn\u2019t feel compelled to work on it anymore, and even after some time the drive to work on it never came back.\n\nI\u2019m sure there are a lot of factors involved, but here are some thoughts on what happened:\n\nOverwhelm\n\nBeing\u00a0overwhelmed with the work that lies ahead before an idea actually becomes a reality is probably the most common cause for dropped, unfinished projects.\n\nThe excitement in the beginning can cloud the truth about how much work actually needs to be done, and so halfway through when you finish the work you enjoyed doing, the rest of it seems like climbing Mt. Everest.\n\nIt\u2019s tough though because everyone says to \u201cjust take action\u201d and \u201cgo for it,\u201d and to an extent I absolutely agree, but at the same time some smart, initial planning and general reality checking\u00a0needs to be done before diving into anything.\n\nThe best thing to do is to familiarize yourself with what work may lie ahead so that you\u2019ll know what to expect. Unexpected things will happen, of course, but the more you learn about what you\u2019re about to do the better chance you have to follow through.\n\nHow do you best familiarize yourself with stuff that\u2019s new to you? Talk to other people and read about it.\n\nBusiness Cards First?\n\nFor some reason, when I was in high school, my friends and I all had business cards. It was \u201ccool\u201d to have a business card with your name on it and some of your skills listed. But the funny thing was, none of us had actual businesses!\n\nBut we were cool because we had business cards, right?\n\nFor Step-by-Step Images, it seems I had adopted the mentality of business cards first, business second. When you think about it, that\u2019s silly.\n\nUnfortunately, this is what a lot of people do. We get an idea but build everything around it before getting into the meat of what that idea is really all about.\n\nIf I had simply started with recording the tutorial videos, I would have learned just how much time each one would take and maybe I wouldn\u2019t have wasted three weeks and a ton of energy on something that I was going to eventually put aside.\n\nIf I had finished the tutorials first, you can be darn sure I\u2019d get everything I built in that first three weeks up and running fast.\n\nAlso, this validates the idea in the first place; the actual meaty business part of the idea. Get that done first, and the rest will fall into place. The business cards will come when you\u2019re ready.\n\nHow many \u201cbusiness card first\u201d ideas have you done that you\u2019ve never finished?\n\nAll of it?\n\nAlong the same line as some advice that was given to us by Dane Maxwell on\u00a0SPI Podcast Session #46, I don\u2019t have to create all 120 tutorials before launching Step-by-Step Images. And really, I shouldn\u2019t.\n\nI could start with fewer\u00a0and still make paying customers happy, and they\u2019d be even happier down the road when any new tutorials come out, instead of using them all up at first.\n\nLet\u2019s say, for example, I start with only the Photoshop Tutorials. I could add the Gimp tutorials later as a value-add and make a big announcement about it. Right there, that cuts away half of the tutorials I need to do before launch.\n\nThen, maybe I could eliminate a couple of the larger categories, like banner ads, for which there are already many tools available online to help people create them. I could then focus on fewer, stronger, and more unique tutorials that are in demand.\n\nThe lesson here is that thinking about every single feature and function of your product or service is smart, but you don\u2019t need all of those things ready before you launch.\n\nWhat are the core things that people need and would be happy to pay for? Focus on that, and then add to it later.\n\nThis\u00a0is exactly what I did to launch my new course, Smart from Scratch! I launched it in October last year (2016) and only a small portion of it was actually finished. After validating the course with a batch of founding students who paid to get access, I then created the rest of the course with them and their valuable feedback.\n\nAnd, by the way, this course is coming out of \u201cbeta\u201d soon, and will be re-opening sometime next month.

You earn nothing until that project is available to the end user.\n\n\u201cOuts\u201d\n\nWhen I started shooting tutorial videos for Step-by-Step Images, it was at the same time I had some other exciting projects going on. A site I built as a result of a\u00a0Niche Site Duel\u00a0was starting to earn hundreds of dollars per month and was growing exponentially. A few weeks prior, I was contacted by a Hollywood producer about potentially working on a film as the Director of Web and Social Media, which I eventually agreed to do.\n\nSo what happens when you work on a project and it gets to a point where it becomes overwhelming and challenging? And you also have other more exciting things going on? You shift your focus to what\u2019s exciting.\n\nI remember a story someone once told me about personal training. Most personal trainers charge you per session. If you don\u2019t make a scheduled session, you have to pay anyway, but they give you one or two\u00a0\u201cfree passes\u201d per month where they won\u2019t charge you.\n\nMy buddy would always tell his personal trainers, \u201cNo free passes. If I don\u2019t show up, charge me, no matter what!\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t want any\u00a0outs\u2014that thing he could fall back on in case something didn\u2019t work out. It\u2019s risky to have outs, even though they are usually there to help you.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause mentally if you know that \u201csafety net\u201d is there, you\u2019ll likely start making excuses.\n\nLet\u2019s say, for example, you were to wake up ten minutes before a session starts one day. If you have that freebie, you might say \u201cWell, I have a freebie, I\u2019ll just fall back asleep.\u201d If you didn\u2019t have that freebie you\u2019re more likely to jump out of bed and sprint out the door like you\u2019re going to miss the bus. Next time, you\u2019ll make sure to double check your alarm clock from that point forward.\n\nIn my situation, the other projects I had going on were my\u00a0outs. I didn\u2019t need to succeed with Step-by-Step Images because I already had all of this other stuff going on, and other things that were successful and generating an income.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder the one moment I sprint up to a hurdle I turn around and walk away.\n\nSo what should I have done instead?\u00a0\n\nFirstly, I needed to stop thinking of my other projects as outs.\n\nGreenExamAcademy.com, my first online business, was a successful because I had no other choice but for it to succeed. I was just laid off and had no other options, including getting another job in the architecture industry, which was impossible. Does this mean I should get rid of everything else I have going on? Of course not, but it means mentally I should treat them as separate projects and should want them each to succeed separately just the same.\n\nSecondly, I should have committed. Looking back, I can\u2019t remember a time when I fully committed to the project. It was the idea I got so excited about I started working on it before truly thinking about it, and so when I got to that stopping point it actually wasn\u2019t very hard for me to just move onto something else.\n\nAnd lastly, I should have pre-sold the idea. If you promise delivery by a certain date you could take pre-orders for your project (potentially with an early-bird discount) and use that money as a resource to help you finish your project, or at least as motivation to get things done and done on time, or else you\u2019re going to have a lot of very angry customers.\n\nWhere will I go from here?\n\nI\u2019m not sure, but this post isn\u2019t all about me, it\u2019s about you too.\u00a0Thank you for sharing my experience with this project. Of course, it\u2019s always tough to admit to failure but life is a learning process and I hope my experiences here have or will help you in some way, shape, or form.\n\nThink about the projects you\u2019re working on right now.\n\nHave you\u00a0truly committed to them?\n\nDo you have any outs that could take your focus away from what you should really be focusing on?\n\nRemember, half-finished projects aren\u2019t the same as eating half of a meal or finishing half of a marathon. You still get a benefit from each of those things, but the\u00a0sad truth about your half-finished project is that in reality, it\u2019s nothing.\n\nYou can\u2019t earn 50% on a project that\u2019s only 50% complete. You earn nothing until that project is available to the end user.\n\nimage\n",
