I received 163 playlists1 with 9,281 songs among them.\n\nAs a result, I\u2019m pleased to introduce FiveThirtyEight\u2019s ultimate wedding playlist, based on the most popular songs among the reception set lists people sent in:\n\nSONG\n\nSET LIST APPEARANCES\n\n1\n\nHey Ya!\n\n69\n\n\u2013\n\n2\n\nI Wanna Dance With Somebody\n\n57\n\n\u2013\n\n3\n\nUptown Funk\n\n55\n\n\u2013\n\n4\n\nShout\n\n54\n\n\u2013\n\n5\n\nCrazy In Love\n\n50\n\n\u2013\n\n6\n\nDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019\n\n45\n\n\u2013\n\n7\n\nBillie Jean\n\n44\n\n\u2013\n\n7\n\nGet Lucky\n\n44\n\n\u2013\n\n7\n\nTwist and Shout\n\n44\n\n\u2013\n\n10\n\nShut Up and Dance\n\n43\n\n\u2013\n\n11\n\nSeptember\n\n41\n\n\u2013\n\n11\n\nDon\u2019t Stop \u2018Til You Get Enough\n\n41\n\n\u2013\n\n13\n\nYeah!\n\n40\n\n\u2013\n\n14\n\nI Want You Back\n\n39\n\n\u2013\n\n14\n\nYou Make My Dreams\n\n39\n\n\u2013\n\n16\n\nSigned, Sealed, Delivered (I\u2019m Yours)\n\n38\n\n\u2013\n\n17\n\nSweet Caroline\n\n36\n\n\u2013\n\n18\n\nHappy\n\n34\n\n\u2013\n\n18\n\nWe Found Love\n\n34\n\n\u2013\n\n20\n\nCall Me Maybe\n\n33\n\n\u2013\n\n20\n\nIgnition (Remix)\n\n33\n\n\u2013\n\nThe ultimate wedding playlist\n\nBefore we dive into the data, let\u2019s go back to those responses, because they were really something else. There were winery weddings and ski lodge weddings, destination weddings and barn weddings. There were big weddings, small weddings, straight weddings, same-sex weddings, secular weddings and big church weddings. I heard from the top live wedding band in California \u2014 all three of them. I received playlists designed for Polish weddings, Indian weddings, French-Canadian weddings and Brazilian weddings, along with the necessary musical additions for weddings in Buffalo, New York. I heard from someone who distributed my analysis of the proper rate of descent during \u201cShout\u201d at his nuptials, which was pretty rad. I had someone send me \u201cThe Rains of Castamere\u201d from an anonymous email account, which as a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d nut I should have seen coming. One person sent me a 20-song playlist composed entirely of \u201cRock Lobster,\u201d which is a far longer song than you likely recall. My heart was warmed by all the stories that couples sent in and then re-frosted when I saw how few of them played \u201cDanza Kuduro.\u201d\n\nAnd the variety of responses really came through in the data. Even though the list of the most popular overall songs suggests a consensus, there was far from total homogeneity. There were 3,358 unique songs in this set. The top 359 songs accounted for just half of the plays. The point: Wedding playlists consist of a core of songs that appear very regularly, plus several more unusual songs that are informed by the choices of the couple and \u2014 based on what people told me in their emails \u2014 the often emphatic recommendations of family.\n\nIt\u2019s very much the same way with the artists:\n\nARTIST\n\nSET LIST APPEARANCES\n\n1\n\nMichael Jackson\n\n202\n\n\u2013\n\n2\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\n130\n\n\u2013\n\n3\n\nThe Beatles\n\n120\n\n\u2013\n\n4\n\nStevie Wonder\n\n108\n\n\u2013\n\n5\n\nOutkast\n\n94\n\n\u2013\n\n6\n\nQueen\n\n88\n\n\u2013\n\n7\n\nRihanna\n\n85\n\n\u2013\n\n8\n\nVan Morrison\n\n74\n\n\u2013\n\n9\n\nThe Jackson 5\n\n73\n\n\u2013\n\n10\n\nJustin Timberlake\n\n71\n\n\u2013\n\n10\n\nWhitney Houston\n\n71\n\n\u2013\n\n12\n\nDaft Punk\n\n69\n\n\u2013\n\n13\n\nPrince\n\n64\n\n\u2013\n\n14\n\nPitbull\n\n63\n\n\u2013\n\n15\n\nLady Gaga\n\n59\n\n\u2013\n\n15\n\nMark Ronson\n\n59\n\n\u2013\n\n15\n\nUsher\n\n59\n\n\u2013\n\n18\n\nJourney\n\n58\n\n\u2013\n\n19\n\nThe Isley Brothers\n\n57\n\n\u2013\n\n20\n\nElvis Presley\n\n52\n\n\u2013\n\n21\n\nEarth, Wind & Fire\n\n50\n\n\u2013\n\n21\n\nFrank Sinatra\n\n50\n\n\u2013\n\n21\n\nKanye West\n\n50\n\n\u2013\n\n21\n\nThe Temptations\n\n50\n\n\u2013\n\n25\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\n49\n\n\u2013\n\n26\n\nDaryl Hall & John Oates\n\n48\n\n\u2013\n\n26\n\nMadonna\n\n48\n\n\u2013\n\n28\n\nDavid Bowie\n\n47\n\n\u2013\n\n29\n\nJay Z\n\n46\n\n\u2013\n\n30\n\nFlo Rida\n\n45\n\n\u2013\n\n30\n\nTaylor Swift\n\n45\n\n\u2013\n\n32\n\nWalk the Moon\n\n44\n\n\u2013\n\n33\n\nKaty Perry\n\n43\n\n\u2013\n\n33\n\nSam Cooke\n\n43\n\n\u2013\n\n35\n\nR.

We didn\u2019t get \u201cdo not play\u201d lists from everyone, so take this with a grain of salt, but a few trends appeared. Line dances are a big presence: Guess some people got burned by the \u201cCha-Cha Slide\u201d and don\u2019t want to mentally go back there. Other polarizing songs include Meghan Trainor\u2019s \u201cAll About That Bass,\u201d \u201cSweet Caroline\u201d and the detestable \u201cBlurred Lines,\u201d as well as the entire catalogs of Dave Matthews Band,2 Maroon 53 and the Village People.4 Hey, it\u2019s your party.\n\nThere are several distinct eras evident in the data. You\u2019ve got your Motown and oldies: \u201cSigned, Sealed, Delivered (I\u2019m Yours),\u201d by Stevie Wonder; \u201cAin\u2019t No Mountain High Enough,\u201d by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell; and \u201cAt Last,\u201d by Etta James. There are hits from the 1970s and 1980s, including Earth, Wind & Fire\u2019s \u201cSeptember,\u201d Journey\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019\u201d \u2014 the song with the most interesting popularity trajectory in pop music5 \u2014 and the B-52s\u2019 \u201cLove Shack.\u201d There\u2019s a robust contemporary contingent \u2014 \u201cUptown Funk,\u201d \u201cShut Up and Dance,\u201d \u201cHappy\u201d and \u201cShake It Off\u201d are hot right now \u2014 plus some established modern icons, including \u201cGet Lucky,\u201d \u201cIgnition (Remix),\u201d \u201cHey Ya!,\u201d \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d and \u201cYeah!\u201d\n\nOne thing this data doesn\u2019t tell us is how wedding playlists have changed over the decades. When new songs join the canon every year, we don\u2019t extend receptions to accommodate them: There\u2019s a finite amount of dance floor time, and all we\u2019ve got is a snapshot here. Still, I am endlessly curious about how these generic set lists would change over time.\n\nMy first thought was that different songs get phased out survival-of-the-fittest style. In 10 years\u2019 time, perhaps \u201cLow\u201d will be the sole vestige of 2007, and its contemporaries \u2014 \u201cCupid Shuffle,\u201d \u201cPaper Planes\u201d and \u201cElectric Feel\u201d \u2014 will be lost to time. But then I saw the distribution of release years, and I contrived a new theory.\n\nThere are peaks centering on the mid-1960s, the early 1980s and (obviously) the last few years. Now, I don\u2019t have any hard proof for this theory besides [expressively waves hand at that chart], but here\u2019s what I think is causing the funky trimodal distribution above: Everyone at the wedding \u2014 the couple, their parents, their parents\u2019 parents \u2014 gets a few songs from when they were in their late teens and early 20s. Let\u2019s do some back-of-the-napkin math. According to the U.S. census, the median age at first marriage for the bride is about 27, so for a 2016 wedding, we can approximate that she was born around 1989. That means her parents would have gotten married in the late 1980s \u2014 let\u2019s just say 1986. Mom would have been 22 or so back then based on the census data, which would place her birth around 1964. That would put the 2016 bride\u2019s grandparents\u2019 wedding around the early 1960s, when the median marriage age for women was 20.\n\nSo it isn\u2019t so much that \u201c\u2018Uptown Funk\u2019 will be absent from weddings within 10 years,\u201d but rather \u201c\u2018Uptown Funk\u2019 may be absent from weddings within 10 years, but it could make a hell of a comeback in 25 years when the 2016 couple\u2019s offspring starts getting married.\u201d\n\nIn the end, receptions are another reflection of the whole point of weddings: starting something new and uncertain and kind of frightening, but beginning it in something traditional and established and fundamentally familiar. As the old saying goes, \u201csomething old, something new, something borrowed, to the window, to the wall, \u2019til the sweat \u2026 [redacted],\u201d or some crap like that.\n\nThe top 200 are here:\n",
