Screen shot via AllThingsD.com\n\nBy Tom McGeveran\n\n11:49 am Feb. 7, 2011 | Tweet this article\n\nIt\u2019s not a marriage, this purchase of The Huffington Post by AOL. It\u2019s more like Arianna Huffington and Tim Armstrong have decided to bunk up so they can move to nicer real estate at lower prices.\n\nWhat Huffington Post started out as\u2014a Drudge Report for the left with an overlay of \u201ccolumns\u201d by influential people who saw posting opinion pieces to the site as analogous to making television appearances to talk about those same things (seldom a paid proposition after all!)\u2014is not really what it is today. Today, looking at it, you could be forgiven for believing an alternate story of its development: that it was started by an online search engine, or an Internet service provider, or a social network, as a way to get in on the advertising game without shouldering the burdens and costs of a real editorial operation.\n\nHuffington Post already acts and feels like a slightly higher-rent version of the AOL homepage.\n\nFrom the readers\u2019 point of view, Choire Sicha makes the most important point in a critique of the New York Times\u2019 piece on the purchase.\n\nWhat\u2019s rather shocking is that the New York Times said of this purchase that AOL is \u201cbetting on news.\u201d Why an actual news-gathering organization thinks that is bizarre. They have confused content with news.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly right, in the sense that what Huffington Post offers is mostly \u201coriginal content\u201d consisting of interested parties\u2019 takes on the news (Kathleen Sibelius or Alec Baldwin or whatever) mixed with links to and aggregation of news that has already appeared elsewhere.\n\nPeter Kafka writes:\n\nHuffington Post still has the reputation as a left-leaning political site written by Arianna Huffington\u2019s celebrity pals. In reality, it is most concerned with attracting eyeballs anyway it can. Sometimes it\u2019s with well-regarded investigative journalism, and much more often it\u2019s via very aggressive, very clever aggregation. And sometimes it\u2019s by simply paying very, very close attention to what Google wants, which leads to stories like \u201cWhat Time Does The Super Bowl Start?\u201c\n\nThis is a game that AOL was failing at and that Arianna Huffington was succeeding at. It is a bet on news in one sense, though: It\u2019s a bet that people want news badly enough that a secondary product, a middleman, is needed to guide them through it all. What value does Huffington post add to the news?\n\nA guy I generally don\u2019t agree with on feelings about media but almost always agree with on facts about the media, Jeff Jarvis, put it pretty well:\n\nOne wonders why big, old media companies didn\u2019t buy Huffington Post. The better question is why they never started their own HuffPos. Only one did: The Guardian. When it saw HuffPo, I remember, its response was, \u2018shit, we should have done that.\u2019 So they did, starting Comment is Free as as vehicle to change its relationship with the public (more than as a business strategy). The New York Times or Washington Post are still too tied to their views of themselves as the founts of all fonts; as far as they may have come, the HuffPo model remains a populist leap too far. TV is is wrapped up in its makeup. I tried to convince many publishers in Germany that they should start HuffPo and not one bit.\n\nWhat is it about the environment of traditional journalism that makes it so that readers are more likely to interact with the Huffington Post reblog of a New York Times article than they are with the article itself? Some of the answers are more obvious than others. And here\u2019s where we depart from Jarvis, who scolds \u201cold media\u201d for its aversion to social news and defends the \u201clink economy\u201d from traditional journalists who see it as a separation of the costs of journalism from the profits. That\u2019s what it is, incidentally, for better (Jarvis\u2019 view) or worse (these unnamed old journalists\u2019 view).\n\nThe slowness of traditional journalism organizations to adjust to the \u201csocial\u201d part of that equation is only partly attributable to their inertia as businesses. It\u2019s also because their very existence is justified by their obligation to readers to vouch for the content they produce. And like it or not, when you\u2019re directing the fire hose of Twitter, Facebook, and unapproved user-uploaded content at your comments section, you are producing their content.\n\nWhat separates the journalist from the commenter or the unpaid contributor? The journalist is being paid a wage to produce the content for an organization whose purpose is to produce content it can vouch for; the journalist is separated from his or her means of living if he breaks trust with the reader. The journalist gets fired.\n\nFrom that point of view, it\u2019s not just a question of traditional news organizations out-muscling Arianna Huffington on her ability to create and monetize engagement with their news; it would be a question of rewriting their rules of doing business from the ground up.\n\nSo it is about values. The initial value proposition for the Times is that it disseminates information that it believes in and will defend, and that it feels accountable to the reader, beyond newsstand sales, to deliver them something of value. To do that, it\u2019s not enough for their audience to believe it\u2019s good. Anyone can find an audience. You have to also believe yourself that it\u2019s good.\n\nArianna Huffington has not signed on to that initial value proposition, so the ones that follow from it don\u2019t apply to her, any more than Ikea is responsible for making furniture that will last for generations, as long as they don\u2019t put a sticker on their kitchen cabinets guaranteeing they will.\n\nThe current space occupied by Arianna Huffington and by other \u201cportal\u201d sites is not just an opportunity lost to major media organizations.\n\nIf, theoretically, CBS and NBC and The New York Times Company could decide to muscle in on this turf (and they probably can\u2019t, at this late date, but stay with me), would they? If they wouldn\u2019t, then aggregation will always be big business, as surely as real-estate brokers or insurance brokers or investment banks or any of the other middlemen that make fantastic money connecting civilians to products will be with us forever.\n\nNext question: Will all this end in tears? Possibly. Arianna Huffington is now an employee of AOL. What she\u2019s had to do at Huffington Post is cover costs and earn a profit. What she will have to do at AOL is make a meaningful contribution to the bottom line against that company\u2019s plummeting value as an Internet service provider. Tim Armstrong tried to commit resources to making AOL a content organization that lived on ad revenue. And the consensus is that it isn\u2019t happening, or isn\u2019t happening fast enough. So much so that AOL sees $315 M. of value in what the Huffington Post is doing.\n\nThe problem when a startup is acquired by a great big behemoth like AOL is that the accounts get muddled. Good days for the Huffington People at AOL will be ones where cost overruns and failed projects in other parts of AOL\u2019s sprawling business are not so egregious as to put sudden clamps on spending they need to make their product. Ken Lerer, Arianna Huffington and a few other people just got quite rich. (Well, quite a lot richer.) But in exchange, the millstone of AOL is now hanging round their necks.\n\nI\u2019m not a banker, so I\u2019ll leave it to smarter people than I to judge the prudence of this deal. It does seem like a very high multiple to pay $315 million for a company with $10 million in profits on $50 million in revenue. But one such smarter person, the aforementioned Kafka, is worth reading on why this makes sense for AOL. His take on why it makes sense for the Huffington Post, though, is short enough to be excerpted here:\n\nHuffPo\u2019s \u201cpro\u201d list is much shorter, but only because there\u2019s not much to think about for them: Huffington, co-founder Kenneth Lerer and their backers get a nice return on the five years and $37 million they put into the company. And those who stay on get to leverage the benefits of a much larger acquirer\u2013access to more eyballs and more advertisers. Easy enough to understand.\n\nArianna Huffington has said it\u2019s like stepping off a fast-moving train onto a supersonic jet. That\u2019s fine and well, as long as the jet isn\u2019t heading into a mountain.\n\nOver at NewsBeast (itself a bit of a pioneer in S.E.O.-forwardness), Dan Lyons dumps all over the deal, extending the metaphor to call it \u201ca slow-motion train wreck.\u201d\n\nMost of what he says is expected, from an old-journalism hardliner: True (Most of the content on Huffington Post is actually pretty terrible! So is most of the content on AOL!) but beside the point, because Lyons is not a guy who thinks about whether quality matters from a business point of view. For that he quotes Nick Denton, whose Gawker Media is now the largest independent blogging empire: \u201cAOL has gathered so many of our rivals\u2014Huffington Post, Engadget, Techcrunch\u2014in one place. The question: Is this a fearsome Internet conglomerate or simply a roach motel for once lively websites?\u201d\n\nDenton is in it to win, as a business. When he talks about quality, he\u2019s not taking a hard line on journalistic values. (It\u2019s not his style, anyway.) Denton does not underestimate the value of quality in the long-run. Today\u2019s redesign of the Gawker sites is proof enough of that.",
