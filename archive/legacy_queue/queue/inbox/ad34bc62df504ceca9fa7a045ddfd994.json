      "Title": "Amazon\u2019s push into fashion retail should scare these companies the most Quartz",
      "Selection": "Amazon\u2019s size and reach\u2014not to mention its willingness to sacrifice profits for market share\u2014make it a company that every other business is scared to go up against. Among them are America\u2019s fashion retailers, who have had to face off with Amazon ever since it started an aggressive push into selling clothes.\n\nCoresight Research, an independent firm focused on retail and technology (formerly Fung Global Retail & Technology), surveyed 1,699 demographically representative, internet-using Americans about what clothing they\u2019re buying on Amazon, as well as the stores they\u2019ve shifted away from. Nobody can yet say with certainty how much business Amazon is siphoning from other fashion retailers, and other than Amazon, nobody knows exactly what customers are buying on the site. But the results offer a hint about which companies should be most concerned about Amazon\u2019s fashion ambitions, and in what areas they\u2019re losing out.\n\nAmazon\u2019s clothing business is getting bigger\n\nVarious sources estimate that Amazon is now the biggest clothing retailer in the country based on merchandise volume, thanks in large part to its massive third-party marketplace. In Coresight\u2019s survey, of the 1,564 respondents who said they bought clothes or footwear in the last year, more had actually done their shopping at Walmart than at any other retailer. But Amazon came in second, just edging out Target and Kohl\u2019s.\n\nThe companies losing clothing dollars to Amazon\n\nThat rapid growth comes at the expense of competitors. Coresight identified 446 people who said they spend more of their clothing and footwear budget at Amazon than they did about three years ago, and asked them which retailers they switched their spending away from. The top answers were Target and Walmart, two of America\u2019s big-box giants.\n\nDepartment stores including Kohl\u2019s, Macy\u2019s, and JCPenney weren\u2019t far behind. Further down the list were inexpensive and off-price retailers, from Old Navy and Gap to TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack.\n\nThe clothing categories Amazon shoppers are buying\n\nCoresight also asked the 719 people in the survey who said they had bought clothing or shoes from Amazon in the last year about what items they were buying. Contrary to the idea that people are just stocking up on socks and underwear, footwear was by far the top category. Women\u2019s and men\u2019s casual clothing took the next spots on the list. It\u2019s still a safe bet that people tend to buy basics on Amazon more than trendy fashion, as other research has found. But the results show that Amazon is finding shoppers who aren\u2019t just loading up on white tube socks.\n\nThe clothing and footwear brands people buy on Amazon\n\nCoresight asked people who had bought clothes or footwear on Amazon in the last year what brands they\u2019d purchased. The results show that another Amazon strategy\u2014private fashion labels\u2014is working well. When combined, its own private labels, including Amazon Essentials, Lark+Ro, Goodthreads, Rebel Canyon, and more, came in ahead of well-known labels like Adidas and Calvin Klein. (The private labels wouldn\u2019t have fared as well individually, of course.) Only Nike, Under Armour, and Hanes beat out Amazon\u2019s private labels.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nOne other notable finding was that survey respondents who were Amazon Prime members were much more likely to have purchased clothing or footwear from Amazon than non-Prime members. In fact, among Prime members, Amazon was the clothing retailer most had shopped at, while among non-Prime members, Amazon was just the seventh most-popular retailer.\n\nFor Amazon, that\u2019s an advantage, as opposed to a problem. Prime membership keeps growing rapidly; by one estimate, more than half of US households now have a Prime account. As Prime continues its spread, the indication is that more of those households will start buying their clothes on Amazon, likely to the detriment of stores such as Target and Walmart. Some companies, such as Nike and Hanes, might benefit. But the one that stands to gain most of all, of course, is Amazon itself.\n\nMost Popular\n",
