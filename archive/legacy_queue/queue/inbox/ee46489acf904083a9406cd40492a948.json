      "Selection": "Every once in a while during my internet travels, I run across something like this video: something impossibly mundane and niche (a ~26-minute video of someone solving a sudoku puzzle) that turns out to be ludicrously entertaining. I cannot improve upon Ben Orlin\u2019s description:\n\nYou\u2019re about to spend the next 25 minutes watching a guy solve a Sudoku. Not only that, but it\u2019s going to be the highlight of your day.\n\nThe solver himself calls it \u201ca work of sublime genius\u201d and \u201cone of the most extraordinary puzzles we\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. It\u2019s fascinating listening to him slowly uncover different aspects of the puzzle \u2014 watching him methodically figure out the 3s was genuinely thrilling. And the symmetry thing at the end\u2026\n\nIf you fancy yourself a sudoku master, you can try solving the puzzle yourself here (keeping in mind the special chess-related rules laid out in the video).
