      "Title": "15 Items You Can Get for Free With the Amex Business Platinum\u2019s Dell Statement Credit The Points Guy",
      "Selection": "Card members of the Business Platinum\u00ae Card from American Express\u00a0just got two valuable new perks: up to $200 in statement credits for Dell purchases each year and\u00a0a complimentary year of global WeWork access.\n\nYou can now sign up for the WeWork benefit, and the Dell statement credit went live right at midnight on Feb. 1. That\u2019s when we learned that the $200 benefit is broken into two different semiannual $100 statement credits for making a purchase through Dell.\n\nThere were a lot of yawns when this benefit was announced. After all, most card members probably figured that you\u2019d have to buy a Dell laptop or Dell supplies to use this credit. However, after diving into Dell\u2019s online catalog, I\u2019m finding literally\u00a0thousands of items for sale through Dell for under $100. These include:\n\n7 docks & stands\n\n319 keyboards & mice\n\n144 batteries, chargers and adapters\n\n318 carrying cases\n\n272 audio\n\n1,090 cables and adapters\n\nThat\u2019s a bunch of options, so let\u2019s highlight some of the items under $100 that might be the most appealing to travelers. Just don\u2019t forget to register for the promotion\u00a0before you make any of these purchases using your\u00a0Business Platinum Card.\n\nIn This Post\n\nKensington SecureTrek backpack: $99.99\n\nThere are\u00a0130 backpacks available for sale through Dell for under $100. The one that stands out to me as the most logical for travelers is the Kensington SecureTrek. Capable of holding up to a 15.6-inch laptop and a 10-inch tablet in padded sleeves, the backpack is designed with a number of anti-theft measures including a locking base and anti-puncture zippers. And it\u2019s not too heavy, at just 3.11 pounds.\n\nIncase City Backpack: $99.95\n\nImage courtesy of Incase.\n\nFor those carrying bigger laptops, the just-under-$100 Incase City Backpack is designed to hold the 17-inch Apple MacBook Pro. Interestingly, this is being sold for $30 cheaper on Dell than it is on Incase\u2019s own website. The sleek backpack features numerous compartments and sleeves to keep everything in place.\n\nTargus Sport Backpack: $23\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a cheap day pack instead, consider the\u00a0Targus Sport Backpack. At just $23, it\u2019s large enough to carry a 15.6-inch laptop while being small enough to be carried on as a personal item \u2014 even on restrictive low-cost airlines like Frontier and Spirit. The blue version is marked down to $22.99 while the black and red versions currently cost $27.99 before tax.\n\nLogitech USB Headset H390: $30\n\nAmong the 149 headphones and headsets available for under $100 through Dell, the $29.99 Logitech USB Headset H390 popped out as a practical choice.\u00a0I\u2019ve found that headsets with a boom mic can be a hands-free neck-saver for long phone calls with airline agents or hourslong holds waiting for a Marriott agent. It\u2019s a wired headset with a USB plug, making it most practical for VOIP calls. But, you might be able to use an adapter to connect your phone.\n\nSony MDR-XB650BT headphones: $98\n\nIf you\u2019d rather go wireless, the\u00a0Sony MDR-XB650BT is currently marked down from $128 to $98. These over-the-ear headphones connect to your phone via NFC or Bluetooth and promise up to 30 hours of battery life. These headphones also have a built-in microphone that also makes it good for making calls. Available in black, blue and red colors.\n\niHome iBT370 portable speaker: $30\n\nI\u2019m such a fan of my\u00a0Oontz Angle 3 portable speaker that I made it my pick for TPG\u2019s holiday gift guide. Unfortunately no Oontz speakers are available through Dell \u2014 although the Angle 3 Plus is available through the TPG Shop. However, there are\u00a0154 other speakers available for under $100. In the budget category, there\u2019s the $29.99 iHome iBT370. Weighing just 5 ounces and with a stated battery life of 8 hours, it\u2019s a light choice for taking your music on the road.\n\nBose SoundLink Micro portable speaker: $79\n\nOn the higher end of the speaker scale is the\u00a0Bose SoundLink Micro \u2014 which is currently marked down to $79 from the standard $99 price. The 10-ounce waterproof speaker seems rugged enough for any travel plans you might have.\n\nSony PS-LX300USB turntable: $98\n\nIn case you missed it, vinyl is making a comeback. According to a recent survey, nearly 50% of vinyl record purchases are by those under 35. Whether you\u2019re a young or old vinyl lover, if you need a new turntable, the\u00a0Sony PS-LX300USB is currently marked down from $128 to $98. Even better, it has a\u00a0PC connection for digitizing old records.\n\nEPSON Expression Home XP-440 printer: $49\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a compact all-in-one printer, scanner and copier for use at home, the EPSON Expression Home XP-440 is currently marked down from $99\u00a0to $49 through Dell. It\u2019s capable of printing up to 10 pages per minute and scanning up to 1200 x 2400 dpi. And it\u2019s a wireless printer for ease of use through your computer, laptop, tablet or phone.\n\nUrban Factory Lipstick 2,600 mAh battery: $11-13\n\nFor those of us who travel with electronics, you know how critical a backup power bank can be to saving the day. Among the 78 portable charging devices under $100, there\u2019s four \u201clipstick\u201d power banks available starting at $10.99. Depending on your phone, these are going to be about one cell phone battery worth of charge.\n\nVisionTek 8,000 mAh battery: $27\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for more than just one charge, the VisionTek battery is one of the best options on Dell\u2019s website when it comes to price per capacity. The 8,000 mAh battery costs just $26.99.\n\nAmazon Echo Dot: $50\n\nIt seems everyone already has a smart speaker in their home. But if you don\u2019t \u2014 or want to upgrade yours \u2014 the 3rd-generation Amazon Echo Dot is available for just $49.99 through Dell in both white and gray colors.\n\nGoogle Home Mini: $49\n\nIf you\u2019re more of a Google fan, you might want to purchase the six-ounce Google Home Mini instead. The Google assistant is available through Dell for just $49 before tax.\n\nMcAfee Total Protection 5 Device: $90\n\nOn the software side, there are 134 options under $100 including a range of photo and video editing tools that travelers may find useful. But, security is paramount \u2014 especially when traveling. If you don\u2019t already have a security solution, you can purchase McAfee\u2019s anti-virus, identity and privacy protection \u201cTotal Protection\u201d bundle through Dell for $89.99 before tax.\n\nMicrosoft Office 365 Personal 1-Year: $70\n\nAnother practical software option is the single-user license of Microsoft Office 365 Personal for $70 or the 5-user Microsoft Office 365 Home for $100. The bundle includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and 1 TB (per user) of online storage through OneDrive. While it\u2019s not the sexiest option on the list, it could be a real money saver for those that\u2019d have to pay for Microsoft Office another way.\n\nWhat Doesn\u2019t Work\n\nDell gift cards can seem like an easy way of maximizing the statement credit \u2014 banking funds for a larger purchase later. Unfortunately, Dell doesn\u2019t sell its own gift cards directly. So, the purchase won\u2019t trigger the statement credit.\n\nMaximizing Your Purchase\n\nBefore you make your purchase,\u00a0make sure to register for the Dell statement credit. And while you\u2019re on the American Express website, check your Amex Offers to see if your\u00a0Amex Business Platinum\u00a0is targeted for an Amex Offer for 10% cash back on Dell purchases:\n\nThe terms of that Amex Offer say that you\u2019ll need to make the purchases through Dell.com/amex. So, you\u2019ll probably want to use this link to make sure that you get 10% cash back. However, if you aren\u2019t targeted \u2014 or want to risk giving up the 10% cash back for potentially even more cash back \u2014 you can click through a cash-back portal such as TopCashBack which is currently offering 5% back:\n\nThat\u2019s not bad, but as Frequent Miler pointed out recently, Cashback Monitor\u2019s history of Dell cash-back rates shows that 20% back offers come around every six months.\u00a0If you\u2019re looking to absolutely max out this $100 Dell statement credit offer, it might be worth waiting for an elevated cash-back offer.\n\nImage from Cashback Monitor.\n\nBy stacking these promotions, you can end up getting a free item \u2014 after statement credit \u2014 plus cash back on top of that. That\u2019s not bad for a new credit card perk that many card members probably weren\u2019t too excited about.\n",
