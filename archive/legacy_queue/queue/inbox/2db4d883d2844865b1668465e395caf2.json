      "Title": "To be less \u201celitist,\u201d J.Crew plans to lower its prices Quartz",
      "Selection": "A decade ago, J.Crew was a defining force in the way Americans dressed. In 2008, its colorful, unfussy prep reached a milestone, when Michelle Obama wore one of the brand\u2019s yellow cardigans on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. That cardigan signified accessibility. Everyone could\u2014and did\u2014wear J.Crew, up to and including the first lady of the United States.\n\nJ.Crew has since fallen dramatically from that position. For more than two years now, sales at stores open at least a year have been dropping. Its image has changed too. Once accessible, J.Crew now believes it has become too \u201celitist,\u201d as CEO Mickey Drexler framed it in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal (paywall).\n\nAs J.Crew does all it can to stabilize its business\u2014some analysts fear that it won\u2019t be able to pay off its $2 billion of debt\u2014it\u2019s working to counter the problem by lowering prices and changing the way it markets itself. It\u2019s already slashing price tags on around 300 items, and using data analytics to determine the best prices for its offerings.\n\nThe retailer also wants to return to being the brand for everyone it once was. The general feeling among former fans is that it got too eccentric in its product and image, especially the styling of its beloved catalogs. The blame is usually put on former creative director Jenna Lyons, who guided the brand\u2019s ascendance, but kept pushing it toward more fashion-forward territory. Shoppers complained that prices got too high, climbing to hundreds of dollars for an item such as a cashmere skirt, and the cool, creative look didn\u2019t match their ordinary lifestyles.\n\n\u201cWe gave a perception of being a higher-priced company than we were\u2014in our catalog, online and in our general presentation,\u201d Drexler told the Journal. \u201cVery big mistake.\u201d In April, J.Crew shook up its organization, parting ways with Lyons and cutting about 250 jobs, primarily from its headquarters.\n\nIt\u2019s also looking to cheaper sourcing options than China and trying to speed up how quickly it can get products into stores. Quicker, cheaper fast-fashion competitors have dominated the market for several years, and J.Crew admits it didn\u2019t foresee how much speed and price would influence what shoppers did\u2014and didn\u2019t\u2014buy.\n\nAccessibility, in both look and price, is J.Crew\u2019s goal now, as it tries to convince people to return to it for their clothes, and without waiting for one of the sales J.Crew seems to have perpetually going on. It won\u2019t be easy. Shoppers expect everything cheaper than ever, and J.Crew faces tough competition from fast fashion.\n\nThings have changed a lot since that yellow cardigan.\n\nMost Popular\n",
