      "Selection": "Disclosure: We get a commission for links on the blog. You don\u2019t have to use our links, but we\u2019re very grateful when you do. American Express, Barclaycard, Chase, and US Bank are Million Mile Secrets advertising partners. Opinions expressed here are the author's alone, and have not been reviewed, approved or endorsed by our partners. Here\u2019s our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nVia One Mile at a Time,\u00a0registration is now open for Starwood\u2019s More For You Promotion. \u00a0And you can\u00a0earn 2X or 3X Starwood points at participating hotels, when you register by November 30, 2016, for stays through December 19, 2016.\n\nEarn Bonus Points for Starwood Stays at Hotels Around the World, Like the W Washington, DC\n\nI\u2019ll show you how to register for this deal. \u00a0And help you decide whether it\u2019s worth it for you.\n\nEarn Bonus Starwood Points With Their Latest Promotion\n\nLink: \u00a0 Starwood\u2019s More For You Promotion\n\nRegister by November 30, 2016,\u00a0and you will earn 2X\u00a0Starwood\u00a0points per $1 spent on weekday\u00a0stays of 2+ nights. \u00a0And\u00a03X\u00a0Starwood\u00a0points per $1 spent on weekend stays of 2+ nights, that include a Friday or Saturday night (Thursday or Friday in Middle East locations).\n\nNote:\u00a0\u00a0 Only base points (not extra points from having elite status) are doubled or tripled.\u00a0 But there\u2019s no limit to the number of bonus points you can earn.\n\nIs This a Good Deal?\n\nIt\u2019s always nice to see a promotion from Starwood because there aren\u2019t many ways to earn Starwood points.\n\nBut you\u2019ll only earn bonus points from this promotion at participating Starwood hotels, so make sure the hotel you\u2019re interested in qualifies. \u00a0Because many hotels in popular destinations, like the Sheraton Walt Disney World Dolphin, are excluded.\n\nAlso, stays booked through 3rd-party sites\u00a0like Orbitz or\u00a0Expedia do NOT qualify. \u00a0And award stays including Free Night Awards and Cash & Points will NOT qualify either.\n\nSo, I wouldn\u2019t suggest going out of your way or changing your travel plans for this deal.\n\nBut, if you already had a Starwood hotel stay in mind (or even if you don\u2019t!), it\u2019s worth registering. \u00a0Because earning a few bonus points is better than nothing. \u00a0And registering is free and easy.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget about other hotel promotions that could make more sense for you, like the\u00a0deals from Hilton\u00a0and\u00a0IHG.\n\nOther Ways to Earn & Use Starwood Points\n\nCheck out my posts about earning and using Starwood points. \u00a0And don\u2019t forget, you can\u00a0transfer Starwood points to many different airlines\u00a0and\u00a0earn 5,000 bonus miles for every 20,000 points you transfer.\n\nOr consider the AMEX Starwood personal and small business cards.\n\nWith both cards, you\u2019ll earn 25,000 Starwood points after meeting the minimum spending requirements.\u00a0 The $95 annual fee is waived the first year.\n\nDo you plan on taking advantage of this deal? \u00a0Let me know in the comments!\n\n* If you liked this post, why don\u2019t you join the 20,000+\u00a0readers who have signed-up to receive\u00a0free blog posts\u00a0via\u00a0email\u00a0(only 1 email per day!)\u00a0or in an\u00a0RSS reader\u00a0\u2026because then you\u2019ll never miss another update!\n",
