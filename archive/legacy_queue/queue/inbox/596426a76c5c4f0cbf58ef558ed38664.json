      "Title": "Watch A documentary reveals the dismal conditions of garment workers for major brands Quartz",
      "Selection": "People in the West hear of the conditions endured by garment workers making clothes in Asian factories, but they rarely see them. A short documentary by the Asia Floor Wage Alliance (AFWA), a group of trade unions and labor rights activists, offers a glimpse of people at work in India, Cambodia, and Indonesia.\n\nIt includes footage from factories, which aren\u2019t necessarily tiny, claustrophobic rooms with decrepit walls and little light. The most startling conditions are where the workers live. Some live in homes that are little more than a single, bare room with no toilet or running water.\n\n\u201cDo you think that workers who are producing high level fashion for the global market should be living like rats?\u201d asks Anannya Bhattacharjee, international coordinator of the AFWA.\n\nThe documentary doesn\u2019t name which brands factories are supplying, but it follows from reports detailing worker abuses at those that supplied H&M, Gap, and Walmart. (We summarized the AFWA\u2019s allegations and the brands\u2019 responses to them in this story.)\n\nIt looks at unsafe workplaces, such as the Rana Plaza factory that collapsed and killed 1,134 people, and how workers are mistreated, including being sexually harassed and beaten during strikes. Its main focus is the effect of extremely low wages.\n\nOne married mother of two who earns $160 a month tells the camera, \u201cThat is just not enough to cover basic expenses.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment repeated in the documentary.\n\nThe AFWA advocates for a living wage based on purchasing power that would cover a worker\u2019s food, housing, clothing, travel expenses, children\u2019s education, and healthcare, while still leaving a small amount for leisure or savings. It\u2019s often more than the minimum wage in a country, but necessary for any worker to lead a decent life, according to the AFWA.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t cost consumers much to bring wages across Asia\u2019s garment-producing countries up to the level recommended by AFWA. Christa Luginbuhl, a coordinator for the labor-rights group Clean Clothes Campaign, says in the documentary that her organization calculated the amount that increasing wages would add to the retail price of a t-shirt. It was just $0.10.\n",
