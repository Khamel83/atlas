      "Title": "LinkedIn is no longer the future of recruiting, according to a former LinkedIn executive Quartz",
      "Selection": "LinkedIn, Monster.com, and other job websites have revolutionized the way that companies look for new hires. But they\u2019ve also made it easier for those companies to sort candidates based on factors like where they went to school and which companies they\u2019ve worked at in the past\u2014which can narrow the pool of candidates and contribute to diversity problems.\n\nDave Foley, the former leader of a global sales unit at LinkedIn, says that his hundreds of former customers were \u201ctypically looking at the same profile\u201d in terms of schools and companies from which they were hoping to recruit. \u201cMany as-good or better candidates are often overlooked because they don\u2019t work or study in traditionally biased institutions like Harvard or McKinsey.\u201d\n\nIn order to make it easier for hiring managers and recruiters to deemphasize attendance at top schools or career history, however, it helps to give them another way to quickly narrow down the candidate pool. That\u2019s where the next generation of recruiting tools comes in.\n\nFolely recently left LinkedIn to join one of a handful of companies that is working on creating metrics that assess candidates fairly, at scale. He is now the head of global sales at Pymetrics, a company that tests potential candidates on more than 90 emotional and cognitive traits such as attention, sequencing, planning, risk profile, reward profile and how to read emotion in others. It then compares the results to those of the company\u2019s current, most successful employees in the role. (That helps zero in on candidates whose traits have helped others be successful at that particular job, within that particular company.)\n\nExperts in hiring diversity say that broadening the pool of candidates from which companies hire is one of the most important aspects of creating better, more-diverse teams. Some non-profit organizations have focused on getting companies to consider candidates with unconventional credentials. Other startups have focused on assessing specific skills regardless of pedigree. A company called HackerRank uses coding challenges as a way for engineers to prove their skills (and for companies to recruit them). Another hiring platform, called Triplebyte, uses anonymous, standardized skills tests to help sort candidates.\n\nBoth of the Pymetrics\u2019 founders are neuroscientists, and the tests the company gives to job candidates, which are presented as games, are based on science. One game that assesses how candidates respond to risk, for instance, presents them with a virtual balloon and asks candidates to make decisions about how much to inflate it. The more air that goes into the balloon, the more game money they receive, but if the balloon pops, they don\u2019t receive any money.\n\nSome of the company\u2019s clients use the tests as part of their application processes. For entry-level jobs, where experience isn\u2019t as much of a factor (\u201cthey don\u2019t have any experience,\u201d Folely notes), companies may source candidates directly from Pymetrics\u2019 pool of candidates. That includes recent college graduates and people who have taken Pymetrics\u2019 assessment while applying for other jobs. The tool complements resumes and other skills-based tests and creates a useful filter for more traditional recruitment processes without necessarily replacing them.\n\n\u201cI see this disruption as for the better,\u201d Folely says.\n",
