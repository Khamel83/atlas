      "Title": "Donald Trump\u2019s video is exactly what we mean when we talk about rape culture Quartz",
      "Selection": "The video surfaced by the Washington Post, in which Donald Trump and television host Billy Bush discuss women in the most vile way is both horrifying and completely unsurprising. Women and their bodies are treated like objects: \u201cshe\u2019s now got the big phony tits and everything\u201d [\u2026] \u201cnice legs, huh?\u201d \u201coh, that\u2019s good legs.\u201d We\u2019ve heard this from Trump before, but what\u2019s new is the outright predation: \u201cI\u2019ve gotta use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrab them by the pussy. You can do anything,\u201d says Trump. He explains: when you are \u201ca star\u201d anything is allowed. That is the description of a sexual assault, coming out of the mouth of a man who is one election away from becoming the world\u2019s most powerful president.\n\nThe video is damning in many ways, but almost as disturbing as Trump himself is the reaction of Bush and another man, who hasn\u2019t been identified, heard in the tape.\n\nWhen we talk about rape culture, this is what we mean.\n\nThe scene is all too familiar: these men are a proxy for all of the men who have ever listened to this type of talk without discouraging it.\n\nThis laissez-faire attitude is what leaves a culture of aggression unchecked and makes the world unsafe for women. Because it\u2019s not just talking: it\u2019s our life. Whenever a woman questions her safety walking alone on a dark street, or when she wonders whether her clothes are too revealing, or when she has the instinct of lowering her gaze, it\u2019s because of men like Donald Trump, who think and say the kind of things he said in this video, and those that stand idly by.\n\nAnd then, to add insult to the injury, is Trump\u2019s first reaction: \u201cthis was locker-room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago,\u201d is the official comment.\n\nOthers, such as investor Anthony Scaramucci, have echoed this idea:\n\nNo one can excuse the statements but they weren't public.Think for a moment of your worst private moment exposed, then start your judgment.\n\n\u2014 Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) October 8, 2016\n\nIt\u2019s a shameful attempt at normalizing a behavior that is appalling and justifying it as something it\u2019s not\u2014regular male camaraderie. All men do this, Trump\u2019s explanation suggests, trying to impose a view of the world where his behavior is acceptable.\n\nBut it is not: the world is full of fathers, brothers, sons, friends, husbands and lovers\u2014men who wouldn\u2019t ever dream of talking about women with such rapacious vulgarity, and who stand up to men when they do.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we are facing today,\u201d said Trump in a video statement.\n\nIn fact, this \u201cdistraction,\u201d as he call it, may well be the end of his run.\n\nTrump\u2019s values (or lack of thereof) embody a problem that is so much larger than this election. Normalizing aggression toward his female opponent is something we\u2019ve now seen countless times. At this point, supporting Trump is reinforcing rape culture, full stop.\n\nThis last video finally turns this vote into a referendum on what is an acceptable behavior to expect from a man in power. For women and their allies, for anyone hoping that one day women will feel safe\u2014no matter how dark the alley, or how short their skirt\u2014this election has an outcome that\u2019s as binary as they come: we win or we lose.\n",
