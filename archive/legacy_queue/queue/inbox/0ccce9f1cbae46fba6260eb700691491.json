      "Title": "The 100 novels Americans love the most, based on a survey of thousands Quartz",
      "Selection": "In 2018, Michael Wolff\u2019s\u00a0Fire and Fury and James Comey\u2019s\u00a0A Higher Loyalty have captured US readers with juicy insights into the Trump White House. But what books bring Americans deep, blithe pleasure?\n\nStarting in May, PBS will run a series called\u00a0The Great American Read, in which journalist Meredith Vieira traverses the country to interview people about their favorite novels. PBS will also run a nationwide survey starting May 22, in which Americans can vote as many times as they\u2019d like for their favorite title among a list of 100.\n\nTo make the top 100 list, polling company YouGov asked a representative sample of 7,366 Americans to answer the question, \u201cWhat is your most-loved novel?\u201d The surveys returned a list of 700 individual titles, which editors culled, limiting it to novels, one title per author, and books published in the US in English.\n\nBased on our count, about half of the books in the top 100 list are considered classics or are books you might see on an American high school curriculum. More than 80 authors on the list are white, and just under 70 are men. Around 60 of the authors are American.\n\nAbout a quarter are books written for kids or teens, and three-quarters have been made into a movie or TV show. Five titles are Christian fiction, and five could be considered dystopian novels. Around 15 are sci-fi or fantasy, and two titles could be considered romances.\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of 100, in alphabetical order going by book title:\n\n1984, by George Orwell\n\nA Confederacy of Dunces, by John Kennedy Toole\n\nA Game of Thrones, by George R.
