All 3 Southwest Cards Offering 60,000 Points\n\nLink: \u00a0\u00a0Southwest Companion Pass\n\nYou have 1 week left to apply for the Chase Southwest Plus or Chase Southwest Premier\u00a0before their increased 60,000 point welcome offers end. \u00a0That\u2019s important to note, because\u00a0without the increased bonuses, it will be harder to earn the\u00a0Southwest Companion Pass!\n\nBy earning 60,000 bonus points from 1 personal and 1 small business Southwest card, you\u2019ll have more than the\u00a0110,000 Southwest points required\u00a0in a calendar year to earn the\u00a0Southwest Companion Pass.\n\nEmily and I consider the\u00a0Southwest Companion Pass\u00a0to be\u00a0the\u00a0best deal in travel! \u00a0That\u2019s because it allows you to bring\u00a0a friend or family member with you for (nearly) free on any paid and award Southwest tickets for\u00a0up to 2 years!\n\nNote: \u00a0\u00a0To get a full 2 years of use from your Companion Pass, timing is very important. \u00a0The Companion Pass is good through the calendar year you earn the points, as well as the following calendar year. \u00a0So if you earn the Companion Pass today, it will be good through December 31, 2018.\n\nIf you apply for the cards now, and wait to complete your\u00a0minimum spending\u00a0after your December 2017 statement closes, your points will post in January 2018. \u00a0So your Companion Pass will be good until December 31, 2019 (nearly 2 full years!).\n\nHere\u2019s a post about timing your spending to earn the Companion Pass in 2017 or 2018.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe\u00a0increased\u00a060,000 Southwest point offers\u00a0for both Chase Southwest personal credit cards\u00a0will end next week, on\u00a0October 4, 2017.\n\nBy opening 2 cards, you\u2019ll earn\u00a0more than enough\u00a0Southwest points to qualify for the\u00a0Southwest Companion Pass. \u00a0It\u2019s\u00a0the best deal in travel!\n\nBut be sure to time the minimum spending correctly to make the most of this deal!\n",
