      "Title": "The uncomfortable, powerful truth every manager realizes after getting a promotion Quartz",
      "Selection": "People usually get promotions because of their outstanding achievements and success. But most good leaders realize a strange paradox while climbing the career ladder. As Sarah Thompson, CEO of global advertising firm Droga5, tells the New York Times: \u201cThere\u2019s less glory the more senior you get.\u201d\n\nIn a \u201cCorner Office\u201d interview with Adam Bryant, Thompson explains that her management philosophy involves directing her energy outward. \u201cYou have to constantly be thinking about how you\u2019re going to make the whole team better. To do that, you have to be kind of selfless. It\u2019s not about winning the meeting or feeling that people would be lost without you.\u201d\n\nThe inverse relationship between seniority and glory can be uncomfortable for a lot of top performers. After all, studies show that from childhood, the right kind of praise makes us more intelligent, happy, and successful. But good management means caring less about getting credit, and more about giving it. Thompson\u2019s advice represents an essential shift in mindset: What if we viewed promotion as commemorating one\u2019s judgment, rather than one\u2019s ability to execute difficult tasks? In this sense, seniority honors one\u2019s ability to facilitate, not spearhead, success\u2014to listen to others, develop good organizational strategies, and shepherd teams toward progress.\n\nDavid Hassell, CEO of the software company 15Five, also promotes the notion that leaders should think of themselves as conductors, not champions. To communicate his values, he flips his company\u2019s organizational chart upside-down. \u201cThink of the CEO as the trunk of the tree \u2014 the one who holds and supports everyone in the organization to grow and keep the vision alive,\u201d he writes on LinkedIn. \u201cThe support trickles up into the branches \u2026 It\u2019s a shift from a management perspective of what can I get from you, to what do you need from me?\u201d Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, also riffs on this perspective, explaining that business leaders ought to be \u201clearn-it-alls,\u201d not \u201cknow-it-alls.\u201d\n\nThis mindset benefits leaders themselves as well as the people they manage. As Emily Esfahani Smith, author of The Power of Meaning: Crafting a Life That Matters, explains in Quartz, the 20th-century psychologist Erik Erikson theorized that in order to lead a meaningful life, humans had to master a certain value or skill at each developmental stage. The most significant task of adulthood, according to Erikson, is \u201cgenerativity\u201d\u2014which Esfahani describes as \u201ccultivating the next generation, or helping other people to accomplish their goals and reach their potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn other words, you\u2019re a successful adult when you outgrow the natural selfishness of your childhood and youth\u2014when you realize that life is no longer about charting your own course, but about helping others, whether it\u2019s by raising children, mentoring colleagues, or creating something new and useful for the world,\u201d writes Esfahani. \u201cGenerative people perceive themselves as part of a larger tapestry and seek to preserve it, however humbly, for future generations. This legacy gives their lives meaning.\u201d\n\nThe idea that \u201cthere\u2019s less glory the more senior you get\u201d is inherently generative. Enacting this mantra demands great humility. But doing so makes leaders more open and receptive to the feedback, ideas, and collaboration necessary for ongoing group success.\n\nChallenging as it may be to adopt this mindset, the result is a happier, more productive team. \u201cIt took me a while to realize that people are going to do things differently than me,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cI had to learn that it\u2019s about setting up the outcomes and quality you want, and giving people more and more freedom to achieve that.\u201d\n\nLearn how to write for Quartz Ideas.
