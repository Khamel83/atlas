      "Selection": "Back in August, I published a comprehensive guide to the new science of treating back pain. Immediately my inbox filled with emails about a doctor readers felt I\u2019d overlooked: the late John Sarno.\n\n\u201cThousands of people, including myself and my husband, cured our chronic back pain using [Sarno\u2019s] methods,\u201d wrote Karen Karvonen. Another Sarno devotee, Steven Schroeder, said the doctor saved his life. Schroeder\u2019s back pain flared whenever he was stressed \u2014 a busy time at work, an illness in his family. After he absorbed Sarno\u2019s books, the discomfort mostly vanished.\n\n\u201cI still sometimes have pain now in times of stress \u2014 but I can literally make it go away with mental focus,\u201d Schroeder, a lawyer in Chicago, wrote in an email. \u201cIt is crazy.\u201d\n\nThough he may not be a household name, Sarno is probably America\u2019s most famous back pain doctor. Before his death on June 22, a day shy of his 94th birthday, he published four books and built a cult-like following of thousands of patients \u2014 including Howard Stern, and Larry David. Many of them claim to have been healed by Sarno, who essentially argued back pain was all in people\u2019s heads. And Sarno himself often said that some 80 percent of his patients got better.\n\nI first came across the back pain guru months ago in my research. But I was skeptical of his theories, which were largely based on hunches and anecdote. He admitted that he never tested his ideas with controlled studies, saying he\u2019d rather spend his time healing patients at his New York University practice than doing research. At first glance, he seemed like an outdated Freudian.\n\nBeloved by his patients, Sarno was also derided by his medical peers. He didn\u2019t have much of an influence on medical research during his lifetime. Tellingly, his NYU colleagues never referred their patients to him.\n\n\u201cIt is not really credible to claim that you can cure 75 percent or more of patients with chronic low back pain, especially since no one has been able to duplicate these kinds of results or even close to it, as far as I\u2019m aware,\u201d said Roger Chou, a back pain expert and professor at Oregon Health and Science University.\n\nBut even if Sarno didn\u2019t play by the rules of science, he endures. He inspired people \u2014 and still does. He managed to write best-selling books and attract patients from across the country to NYU. He\u2019s the subject of a 60 Minutes feature and a recent documentary, All the Rage: Saved by Sarno, that was screened around the world. Sarno\u2019s followers continue to record their stories on their \u201cThank You, Dr. Sarno\u201d project. \u201cI know you never liked hearing it, but I owe my life to you,\u201d Ted H. wrote in July.\n\nAfter digging a little deeper, I learned that some of Sarno\u2019s theories are now even being validated by science \u2014 specifically, that there can sometimes be an emotional basis for chronic back pain. And that\u2019s an important truth mainstream pain medicine still hasn\u2019t quite figured out what to do with.\n\nSarno believed our brain used pain to distract us from experiencing negative emotions\n\n Sarno argued back pain arose as a result of a psychosomatic process and emotional factors. Angie Wang\n\nLower back pain is among the chief reasons people go to see a doctor in the US, and nearly a third of American adults say they\u2019ve been afflicted. The US spends approximately $90 billion a year on back pain \u2014 more than the annual expenditures on high blood pressure, pregnancy and postpartum care, and depression \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t include the estimated $10 billion to $20 billion in back pain-related lost productivity.\n\nDoctors have overwhelmingly failed people with back pain. Many of the most popular treatments on offer \u2014 bed rest, spinal surgery, opioid painkillers, steroid injections \u2014 have been proven ineffective in the majority of cases, and sometimes downright harmful. Only in the past couple of years, with the rise of the opioid epidemic, has the medical establishment begun to acknowledge this failure and suggest people explore alternatives for their sore backs.\n\nEnter John Sarno. A specialist in rehabilitation medicine, he had very different notions about the causes of back pain than his medical peers. Sarno was most active during the 1980s and \u201990s, a time when back discomfort was thought to arise mainly in the presence a mechanical problem (a bulging disc, say, or joint arthritis). Instead, he argued the pain was actually the result of a psychosomatic process and emotional factors.\n\nMore specifically, he believed that the brain distracts us from experiencing negative emotions by creating pain. We may not want to accept the uncomfortable truths that we are angry with our children, or that we hate our job, so instead of thinking those thoughts, we focus on the pain.\n\nHe also thought that pain was created by reduced oxygen and blood flow to the muscles and nerves of the body. So our brains unconsciously direct blood away from certain areas of our body, and that creates pain. (If this focus on the unconscious mind sounds familiar, it\u2019s because Sarno was heavily influenced by Freud. His book The Divided Mind was all about psychosomatic medicine, including Freud\u2019s pivotal influence.)\n\nSarno coined a term for his diagnosis \u2014 \u201ctension myoneural syndrome\u201d \u2014 and believed many people could overcome their pain simply by acknowledging its psychosomatic origins. He instructed many of his patients to journal or seek out psychotherapy, to gain a better understanding of the emotions they were repressing that generated their chronic back pain. He also advised they immediately resume physical activity, that it would make them better and not worse.\n\nTo get a feel for his approach, here are some of the dos and don\u2019ts from Healing Back Pain, published in 1991:\n\n Back pain dos and don\u2019ts in John Sarno\u2019s Healing Back Pain.\n\nMany doctors still think Sarno\u2019s views on back pain are off\n\nBack pain researchers and doctors generally didn\u2019t find Sarno convincing \u2014 and many still don\u2019t. Andrea Furlan, a psychiatrist who has published numerous systematic reviews on back pain, says the big problem with Sarno\u2019s approach was that it was too \u201cone-size-fits-all.\u201d Some people\u2019s back pain may be exacerbated by emotional problems or stress, but not everyone\u2019s. \u201cI think it is a mistake to generalize [the mind-body model] to all people with back pain,\u201d Furlan said.\n\n\u201cBlaming this all on repressed emotions is a pretty narrow view of psychological contributors to pain,\u201d Oregon\u2019s Chou added. \u201cIt ignores a lot of what we understand now about changes that occur centrally in persons with chronic pain.\u201d For example, we now have MRI studies showing that people with chronic pain have different areas of their brain light up when they are exposed to painful stimuli.\n\n\u201cSarno had no interest in seeing brain MRIs,\u201d said Cathryn Jakobson Ramin, author of the book Crooked: Outwitting the Back Pain Industry and Getting on the Road to Recovery. \u201cHe was actually very limited in his scope ... until his last days, stuck in a Freudian mindset, viewing what was going on with patients as evidence of psychological problems rather than neurological problems.\u201d\n\nThe mechanism Sarno proposed \u2014 about decreased blood flow caused by the brain \u2014 was also never supported by science, explained Howard Schubiner, who heads a mind-body medicine program at Providence Hospital in Michigan, which was inspired by Sarno\u2019s work. \u201cIt made no sense to a lot of scientists and physicians.\u201d\n\nBut there are some things Sarno got right, Schubiner added. \u201cThe science is catching up to Dr. Sarno.\u201d\n\nSarno got some things right\n\n Sarno with Michael Galinsky, maker of the documentary All the Rage: Saved by Sarno. Rumur Inc.\n\nIt\u2019s now mainstream to view chronic back pain as a \u201cbiopsychosocial\u201d condition \u2014 meaning biological factors (such as a person\u2019s weight or spine structure) may play a role but psychological and social factors can too. Researchers have found, for example, that people who are under stress or are prone to depression, catastrophizing, and anxiety tend to suffer more with chronic back pain, as do those who have histories of trauma in their early lives or poor job satisfaction.\n\n\u201cWas [Sarno] the first person to discover the mind-body connection? Or course not,\u201d said Schubiner. \u201cBut Sarno popularized it [in the area of back pain].\u201d\n\nA new understanding of pain, commonly referred to as \u201ccentral sensitization,\u201d is also gaining traction. The basic idea is that in some people who have ongoing pain, there are changes that occur between the body and brain that heighten pain sensitivity \u2014 to the point where even things that normally don\u2019t hurt are perceived as painful. That means some people with chronic low back pain may actually be suffering from malfunctioning pain signals. So again, it\u2019s what\u2019s going on in the mind that matters for their pain, more so than what\u2019s going on in their bodies.\n\nNow, this doesn\u2019t mean everybody\u2019s back pain has a psychological root cause. It also doesn\u2019t mean the mechanism Sarno suggested \u2014 decreased blood flow created by the brain \u2014 has been validated, or that it\u2019s repressed emotions that hurt people. But Sarno was ahead of the science with his broader mind-body approach.\n\nSarno-esque approaches are slowly catching on\n\nThere were other things Sarno got right, whether or not the science of his time backed him up. He was also a strong advocate that people with back pain shouldn\u2019t take bed rest and stop their daily activities, which were pretty mainstream remedies in the 1980s and \u201990s, when he was publishing his books.\n\nDoctors now think that bed rest is a very bad idea in most cases, and studies comparing exercise to no exercise for chronic low back pain are consistently clear: Physical activity can help relieve pain, while being inactive can delay a person\u2019s recovery.\n\n\u201cWhat he recommended as treatment was essentially cognitive behavioral therapy \u2014 elimination of fear avoidant behavior and catastrophizing \u2014 before anyone had ever heard of it,\u201d Ramin said, \u201cand it\u2019s exactly what is being used now to treat patients with central sensitization.\u201d\n\nSarno-esque approaches are slowly catching on for back pain. \u201cMultidisciplinary rehabilitation\u201d is increasingly popular. This approach views back pain as the result of the interplay of physical, psychological, and social factors. Practitioners do things like help patients get treatment for their depression or anxiety, or guide them through cognitive behavioral therapy to improve their coping skills as part of their back pain therapy. (As I noted in my guide to back pain science, multidisciplinary therapy appears to work slightly better than physical therapy alone for chronic back pain in both the short and long term.)\n\nSchubiner has co-authored several studies looking at the impact of Sarno-style pain management. The most recent, published in the journal Pain, was the first large-scale randomized controlled trial to show that guiding people with chronic pain (in this case, caused by fibromyalgia) through how to process and express powerful emotions such as anger worked better than regular cognitive behavior therapy at reducing fibromyalgia symptoms.\n\nSarno also intuitively understood that anatomical abnormalities like lumbar disc bulges are not actually the source of pain for many people \u2014 and called these injuries \u201cnormal abnormalities.\u201d Research over the past two decades has piled up to prove him right. For example, when you compare people with the same MRI results showing the same back injury \u2014 bulging discs, say, or facet joint arthritis \u2014 some may experience terrible chronic pain while others report no pain at all.\n\nAfter testing Sarno\u2019s methods, Schubiner now thinks the people who say they have been cured by Sarno are probably a minority of outspoken patients with back pain that happens to be exacerbated by stress or emotional problems. That means there are people out there with chronic pain who could benefit from psychotherapy. But that\u2019s not true for every back pain patient. (And there are surely other people who didn\u2019t experience life-changing healing after reading Sarno but are less likely to speak up.)\n\nAt the end of the recent Sarno documentary, his fans from the \u201cThank You, Dr. Sarno\u201d project present him with a book of people\u2019s healing stories. Sarno says, \"All of this because of one simple idea: the fact that the mind and the body are intimately connected. That's it. That\u2019s the whole story.\"\n\nMichael Galinsky, the maker of the documentary, told me this line from the documentary resonated. \u201cWhile that might seem to be an obvious truth, the biotechnical approach to medicine essentially negates it in regards to practice,\u201d Galinsky said. That\u2019s now slowly shifting, but it took an unprecedented opioid epidemic \u2014 instead of a charismatic doctor \u2014 to spur change.\n",
