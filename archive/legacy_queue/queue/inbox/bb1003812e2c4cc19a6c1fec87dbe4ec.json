      "Selection": "It probably won\u2019t look like this for long. \n \nThe media landscape used to be straightforward: Content companies \u2014 studios \u2014 made stuff \u2014 TV shows and movies \u2014 and sold it to pay TV distributors, who sold it to consumers. \n\nNow things are up for grabs: Netflix buys stuff from the studios, but it\u2019s making its own stuff, too, and it\u2019s selling it directly to consumers. That\u2019s one of the reasons older media companies are trying to compete by consolidating. Disney, for example, recently completed its purchase of 21st Century Fox. Distributors like AT&T, which bought Time Warner last year, are becoming media companies, too.\n\nMeanwhile, giant tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Apple that used to be on the sidelines are getting closer and closer to the action. Apple\u2019s newest TV strategy positions the company as a TV guide, a TV storefront selling services like HBO, and a TV creator that employs the likes of Steven Spielberg and Jennifer Anniston to make exclusive shows for Apple users.\n\nTo help sort this all out, we\u2019ve created a diagram that organizes distributors, content companies and internet video companies by market cap \u2014 the value investors assign to the companies \u2014 and their main lines of business. \n\nHere\u2019s what the Big Media universe currently looks like.
