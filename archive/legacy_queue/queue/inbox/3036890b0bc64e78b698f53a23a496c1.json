      "Selection": "Some folks claim that if you do what you love, the money will follow. Others say that a job is just a job \u2014 you\u2019re not meant to like it. The truth lies somewhere between these two extremes. There are few things worse than a job you hate; and many people enjoy fun, fulfilling careers while earning a good living.\n\nWhatever the case, any job is more bearable if you\u2019re paid well. Plus, a high wage means more money to pursue your goals and dreams. One of the best ways to increase your income is at the source: during salary negotiations when you land a job.\n\nWhy You Should Negotiate Your Salary\n\nFor many people, salary negotiations are awkward or scary. But in his book Negotiating Your Salary: How to Make $1000 a Minute, career coach Jack Chapman argues that those few minutes during which you ask for more money in an interview can make a difference of tens of thousands of dollars over your lifetime. Maybe even hundreds of thousands. He says you can literally earn $1,000 per minute if you do this right.\n\nResearch backs him up. According to a 2010 study conducted by George Mason University and Temple University, failing to negotiate on an initial job offer could mean missing out on over $600,000 in salary during a typical career.\n\n\u201cWe spend years thinking about what we\u2019ll be when we grow up,\u201d Chapman writes. \u201cBut when it\u2019s time for a raise, most of us just accept whatever we\u2019re offered. How many minutes do we spend negotiating the money? Zero.\u201d\n\nOnly about half of all applicants negotiate their salary; don\u2019t be one of these folks. If you don\u2019t ask for more money, your employer certainly won\u2019t just give it to you.\n\nBefore we look specifically at negotiating salary, let\u2019s review the basics of negotiation in general.\n\nYou Can Negotiate Anything\n\nIn his book You Can Negotiate Anything, Herb Cohen writes that there are three crucial variables in every negotiation:\n\nPower, or the ability to get things done. In salary negotiations, you gain power from perceived expertise or legitimacy. The better qualified you are for a position, the more leverage your have. You also gain power through persistence, attitude, and taking calculated risks. You have power if you\u2019re willing to walk away; if you\u2019re not, the company can name its price.\n\nTime. In negotiations, the side with the most time generally has an advantage. No matter how much pressure you\u2019re under, always keep your cool, maintaining an appearance of calm. Having other options buys you time. You\u2019re in a better bargaining position if you already have a job (or job offer) and don\u2019t need to accept his one. When you believe you have to have something, the other side can easily manipulate you.\n\nInformation is the final piece of the puzzle. The more you know, the stronger your position. Do your research before you negotiate. During negotiations, act on whatever new info comes to light. The interviewer\u2019s questions, responses, and attitude all give you valuable information.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at two (very similar) methods for negotiating your salary.\n\nNote: Remember that these techniques are generally applicable for discussions during a performance review. You can use these ideas to ask for a raise, not just to negotiate your salary for a new position.\n\nHow to Negotiate Your Salary\n\nIn Negotiating Your Salary, Jack Chapman offers five rules for getting what you want.\n\nFirst, postpone salary negotiations until after you\u2019ve been offered a job (or finished a performance review). Chapman says the hiring (or evaluation) process consists of two phases: judging and budgeting. You can only hurt yourself by dealing with salary when the employer is judging instead of budgeting.\n\nSecond, let the other side make the first offer. According to Chapman, it\u2019s tough to win by being the first to name a number. For many people, it can be awkward to evade direct questions about salary expectations. Chapman recommends preparing for this situation. His website includes a short video on how to answer the question, \u201cWhat are you earning?\u201d (You might also read Penelope Trunk\u2019s advice on how to answer the toughest interview question.)\n\nWhen you hear the offer, repeat the top value \u2014 and then be silent. \u201cThe most likely outcome of this silence is a raise,\u201d Chapman writes. This technique buys you some time to think while putting pressure on the employer.\n\nNext, counter the offer with a researched response. Your next move is to make a counter-offer based on what you know about yourself, the market, and the company. Before you go into the interview, have a minimum salary in mind. Base this on careful research using tools like LinkedIn, Salary.com, CareerBliss.com, PayScale.com, and GlassDoor.com. Also take the time to ask friends and colleagues for confidential feedback on what the position you want ought to pay. This information will give you power.\n\nFinally, clinch the deal \u2014 then deal some more. The final step in salary negotiations is to lock in the offer, and then negotiate additional benefits. This is like locking in the price of the car you\u2019re buying before you begin negotiating the value of your trade-in.\n\nThe Noel Smith-Wenkle Salary Negotiation Method\n\nChapman isn\u2019t the only one espousing these techniques. My research shows that all effective headhunters and coaches essentially advocate the same salary negotiation process.\n\nFor instance, Noel Smith-Wenkle was a job headhunter during the 1980s. He developed the following method to get as much money for his clients as possible during salary negotiations (which, in turn, meant a greater commission for him).\n\nSmith-Wenkle\u2019s number-one rule is: never tell the employer how much you\u2019ll take. Let the company name the first number. (Chapman gives the same advice. So does almost every other negotiation coach.)\n\nThe Smith-Wenkle Salary Negotiation Method involves four carefully prepared responses:\n\nIf the company asks for a salary expectation on the application, leave it blank.\n\nWhen the company verbally asks how much you want, say, \u201cI\u2019m much more interested in doing [type of work] here at [name of company] than I am in the size of the initial offer.\u201d Smith-Wenkle says this will work about 40% of the time.\n\nIf the company asks a second time, your answer should be: \u201cI will consider any reasonable offer.\u201d This is a polite stalling tactic, and Smith-Wenkle says this will work another 30% of the time.\n\nAbout 30% of the time, you\u2019ll have to respond again. (Smart hiring managers know they shouldn\u2019t be the first to make an offer.) Again, your response is a polite refusal to answer the question: \u201cYou\u2019re in a much better position to know how much I\u2019m worth to you than I am.\u201d This is your final answer, no matter how many times the company tries to get you to go first.\n\nThe sole purpose of this method is to get the company to be the first side to name a number. Once the company makes an offer, you have two options. If the offer is above your minimum, take the job. If it\u2019s below your minimum, tell them it\u2019s too low \u2014 but don\u2019t say by how much.\n\nMore Info on Salary Negotiation\n\nOver the past decade, I\u2019ve talked to several people about how they\u2019ve successfully negotiated their salaries. All of them have stressed two factors: preparation and practice.\n\nRemember that the purpose of a job interview (or performance review) is to sell yourself. If you don\u2019t believe you\u2019re worth the price you\u2019re asking, your employer won\u2019t believe it either.\n\nDraft a list of ways you\u2019ve helped current and past employers. Measure your achievements in dollar terms, if you can. (For instance: \u201cBy finding a new supplier for our packaging supplies, I\u2019ve saved the firm $50,000 over the past year.\u201d) Create a written list of talking points and use this to make your case for a higher salary.\n\nIf you\u2019re just starting out \u2013 you\u2019re a recent university graduate or moving to a new career \u2013 you might not have hard numbers to prove your worth. In that case, pitch your enthusiasm and work ethic.\n\nAnd the practice portion? Don\u2019t let the actual interview be the first time you try your \u201cflinch\u201d or try to deflect questions about salary. As silly as it might sound, take some time to role-play with your spouse or a friend. Have them take the role of hiring manager and ask them to grill you so that you can see what it feels like to handle common questions. (For added fun, turn the tables and you take the role of hiring manager.)\n\nNegotiating your salary is one of the best ways to improve your financial position. And it\u2019s a move that can have an enormous impact on your financial future. When you negotiate a better salary on this job, that number will help you when you negotiate the salary for your next job. It\u2019s like a giant snowball of money! And it\u2019s a snowball you can directly influence by making it as big as possbile at the beginning.\n\nWant more info on how to negotiate salary?
