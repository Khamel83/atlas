      "Selection": "So many choices when saving your images! The Image File Types Decoded infographic from tekRESCUE does a great job of clarifying the options in this handy infographic!\n\nInformation technology can get complicated very quickly, and digital image files are no exception to this rule. You\u2019ve likely come across a few of the different types of image files such as JPEGs, GIFs, PNGs, and others. You\u2019ve also likely wondered what the difference is between all of these different abbreviations. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve put together an infographic comparing some of the most common types of files you\u2019re likely to encounter on and create for the web.\n\nIn the graphic, we take a play-by-play look at the different properties of digital images and how the properties relate to each file type. We hope you\u2019ll find the information useful whether you\u2019re an image newbie or a seasoned graphic designer. Skip below the infographic if you prefer to digest the information in text form.\n\nSome of the topics, like Image Compression, are over-simplified for purposes of this infographic. JPG is the king of file compression, but the infographic implies that other file types don\u2019t support compression. That\u2019s not exactly true. They have compression, but it isn\u2019t anywhere as effective as JPG.\n\nFound on Infographic Journal\n",
