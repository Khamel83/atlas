      "Title": "An Obsessive Ranking of Every \u2018My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\u2019\u2013Era Kanye Song The Ringer - Features",
      "Selection": "Luca Romeo\n\nTo mark the 10th anniversary of Mr. West\u2019s magnum opus, we\u2019re headed back to Obama\u2019s first term to figure out what was the best of Ye\u2019s best\n\nJustin Sayles: Charles, we have a big album anniversary that we have to face today. It\u2019s for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Kanye West\u2019s magnum opus/mea culpa that came out on November 22, 2010. (Do not ask me how old I was on that date, or I will forward this Google doc straight to HR.) This anniversary is difficult to deal with\u2014at the time of its release, so many people declared it a nearly perfect album. (In fact, Pitchfork stamped it as fully perfect, awarding it a 10.0, something it wouldn\u2019t do for another album for a decade.) The hyperbole made sense back in those heady days of the first Obama administration. Kanye was at the peak of his craft and returning from a yearlong shame walk following his infamous 2009 VMAs incident. The music was ambitious, the Hawaiian recording sessions took on mythic status, and the features were pure critic bait (he introduced Bon Iver\u2019s Justin Vernon to a hip-hop audience, even if their definitive collaboration wouldn\u2019t come until \u201cHold My Liquor\u201d three years later).\n\nBut all of these ideas seem quaint now, with a dramatically changed hip-hop landscape, a Kanye-Trump friendship and comical presidential bid, a borderline disastrous Wyoming detour and gospel album, and \u201cPoopy-di scoop\u201d all sitting between MBDTF and the present. But they\u2019re still worth exploring. In fact, you\u2019ve done so: In the first episode of your new podcast, The Ringer Music Show, you spoke to Kanye collaborators about the who, what, where, and why of that album. And let me say, I learned a lot, and I think even the biggest Kanye stans will.\n\nSo let\u2019s not rehash that all here. Instead, I want to do something you suggested we do for this anniversary. I want to rank every Kanye song and feature from the MBDTF era, or as it\u2019s known to diehards, the Rosewood era. Charles, do you want to begin by explaining what Rosewood is and why this matters in the Kanye story?\n\nCharles Holmes: The Rosewood Movement was part fashion movement, part respectability politics masked as rehabilitation. In short, Kanye forced all of his G.O.O.D. Music artists, entourage, and weed carriers to wear Dior Homme\u2019s Black Classic Skinny Suit that retailed for $2,200 in 2010 at all times. \u201cThat\u2019s the Rosewood mentality, like affluence, like not cursing loud in public, pulling out chairs for your lady, opening up doors,\u201d West explained to DJ Clue. On a macro level, it\u2019s also a nice distinction for this time period for MBDTF, G.O.O.D. Fridays, and the features he dropped before and after.\n\nJS: OK, so taking the songs from the album, the G.O.O.D. Friday free releases (which sadly aren\u2019t available outside of shitty YouTube uploads and illegal Soundcloud links), and guest spots, we\u2019ve got 30 or so tracks to work with. That means we\u2019ve got a lot of words to write. So let\u2019s begin, starting with the absolute worst Kanye-related track of that era \u2026\n\n Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nKanye West performs at the 2010 BET Awards\n\nLevel 6: O.K. Music\n\n30. \u201cDeuces (Remix)\u201d (Chris Brown single)\n\nCH: In retrospect, it\u2019s wild that \u201cDeuces\u201d was such a hit a decade ago that Chris Brown could unite Rick Ross, Drake, T.I., Kanye West, Fabolous, and Andr\u00e9 3000 for a remix. The song has aged about as well as any 2010s song that was in heavy rotation on Hot 97 can, meaning it\u2019s quite honestly terrible. Kanye\u2019s verse is especially egregious, considering lines like \u201cYou should have a travel agent, \u2019cause you a trip / You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit,\u201d weren\u2019t left on the cutting room floor.\n\nJS: It\u2019s a little sad listening to Andr\u00e9, who was in the middle of an iconic five-year run of features, relegated to mop-up duties, which he sleepwalks through here. His verse is also a tough listen after sitting through Ye, Fabolous, and Ross, in particular; when Dre says, \u201cGet your minds out the gutter,\u201d he may as well have been talking to them. This song proves only that Chris Brown brings the worst out of everyone around him.\n\n29. \u201cThe Joy\u201d (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nJS: Charles, I suspect ranking this song so low will get us yelled at on Twitter, but I\u2019m not a huge fan of \u201cThe Joy,\u201d and I\u2019ve never been as proud to work with you as when I discovered you felt similarly. It\u2019s somewhat of a waste of Curtis Mayfield and Pete Rock, my all-time favorite producer and one of the key people in elevating sampling into high art. But high art is not what happens here. The beat is fine\u2014a relaxed, minimalist excursion that would\u2019ve likely been an interlude on any of Pete\u2019s LPs. But to me, the song is destroyed by some of the cringiest Kanye lyrics of the era. Like, look at this shit:\n\nShe in her birthday suit \u2018cause of the damn cake\nNow there\u2019s crumbs all over the damn place (Uh-huh)\nAnd she want me to cum all over her damn face\n\nAnd:\n\nSo next time you see me on your fallopian\nThough the jewelry\u2019s Egyptian, know the hunger\u2019s Ethiopian\n\nMaybe I\u2019m a prude, but I never want to hear Ye say cum or fallopian. People love this song, though\u2014so much so that it was tacked onto 2011\u2019s Watch the Throne. What\u2019s up, Charles? Are we right, or is it the kids who are wrong?\n\nCH: This is the perfect example of a song where everyone involved is so enamored of the sample that they collectively decide not to show up in any other regard. If someone had a gun to my head and told me to recite one lyric from this song, I\u2019d just have to tell someone to feed my cat, Sushi, \u2019cause I\u2019m not making it.\n\n28. \u201cChain Heavy\u201d (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nCH: I\u2019m almost positive Kanye premiered this song standing on a table and rapping it a cappella to the Facebook office. Also, totally forgot this was the same year David Fincher\u2019s The Social Network was released, which might explain our relationship to Mark Zuckerberg at the time of MBDTF. Zuck had yet to upend all of American democracy in 2010, so he was still in the midst of his myth-making years, which is similar to Rosewood-era Kanye. Nevertheless, \u201cChain Heavy\u201d always sounded better as a snippet.\n\nJS: I have this song slightly higher in my personal rankings, mainly because I\u2019m a sucker for Q-Tip production and Consequence features. But I think \u201cChain Heavy\u201d got buried a little by virtue of being the last song in the G.O.O.D. Friday series before the release of MBDTF. By that point, Ye had to know he was dropping outtakes.\n\n27. \u201cRunaway Love (Remix)\u201d (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nCH: Back in 2010, Kanye placing Raekwon on a baby-faced Justin Bieber single was an expert troll job disguised as some genius idea. Besides the novelty of putting Raekwon\u2019s razor-like voice over the bubblegum hit, this G.O.O.D. Friday track was seen as filler even back then.\n\nJS: Charles, does the \u201cWu-Tang Clan Ain\u2019t Nuthing ta F\u2019 Wit\u201d sample mean anything to you?\n\nCH: I have a long and complicated relationship with the Wu-Tang Clan. It mostly stems from the fact that I come from a small town in New Jersey where my seventh grade teacher was white, in his mid-20s, and didn\u2019t see a problem with gloating to one of his only Black students that he didn\u2019t know as much Shaolin as he did. White bros love them some Wu-Tang, but after some soul searching I realized I wouldn\u2019t allow the Wu to be gentrified in my life. So that\u2019s a long way of saying \u201cWu-Tang Clan Ain\u2019t Nuthing ta F\u2019 Wit\u201d means a lot to me and Kanye should\u2019ve just stayed away from it.\n\nJS: I wonder what other rappers \u201ccool teachers\u201d have ruined for kids. Like, there\u2019s definitely some English teacher in Missouri that never misses the opportunity to talk to his students about MF Doom.\n\nMy next question: This is one of Bieber\u2019s first \u201chip-hop\u201d tracks. That means it may be indirectly responsible for \u201cMaria I\u2019m Drunk,\u201d on which he arguably outrapped Travis Scott and Young Thug. (The latter sounds borderline blasphemous, but it\u2019s true.) Does that make this remix a net positive?\n\nCH: Kanye put the battery in Biebervelli\u2019s back, so yes. Honestly, I\u2019d like to see the Chef and JB on a track together in 2020. I\u2019m positive my Canadian brother would lyrically hold his own.\n\n26. \u201cDon\u2019t Look Down\u201d (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nCH: This is an honest question\u2014why does Kanye let Mos Def sing badly on so many of his songs? I\u2019m probably in the minority of people who think the only salvageable part of 2007\u2019s \u201cDrunk and Hot Girls\u201d is the Mos Def part, but that\u2019s not exactly some high compliment. \u201cDon\u2019t Look Down\u201d aspires to be more than it is. Lupe Fiasco has an esoteric verse about a phoenix. Kanye bathes his voice in some distortion that sounds like a cheap imitation of what he\u2019d use on \u201cRunaway.\u201d Surprisingly, Big Sean has the best verse by miles, which is a theme throughout most of these G.O.O.D. Friday tracks. At a time when Sean was relegated to the periphery of G.O.O.D. Music, he generally proved his worth by putting in more effort than the bulk of his compatriots.\n\nJS: I mean, Mos isn\u2019t a technically great singer, but \u201cUmi Says\u201d is a classic, to say nothing of \u201cDefinition.\u201d (I suspect you feel differently, Charles.) There are far greater problems with the song, including the overwrought production, which drags for nearly six minutes. But mostly, I\u2019m confused about why you\u2019re highlighting a verse that includes the lines \u201cTrying to get high enough to cut the clouds / Of the Phoenix Sun and Nash it out / I mean ash it out so I could see you smile.\u201d That\u2019s a tough sell, even by the standards of Big Sean\u2019s wordplay.\n\n25. \u201cTake One for the Team\u201d (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nCH: An utterly forgettable song with a Kanye verse that is way too aggro, but I\u2019d like to point out one thing. Toward the middle of Kanye\u2019s verse, he raps, \u201cWhy every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell / Or that Goddamn cucumber Bath and Body Works?\u201d First of all, my question to you, Justin, is simple. Do you like cucumber scents and/or Bath and Body Works?\n\nJS: I have to confess, Charles. I\u2019m one of those guys who uses two-in-one shampoo/conditioners and buys whatever body wash is closest to me in the store when I remember I need it. If one of those things happens to be cucumber-scented, cool. But I don\u2019t have strong opinions.\n\nCH: We need to boss your life up, JS. I\u2019m talking about strolling over to the local mall and getting some Lush bath bombs. In this Ringer household, we only bathing in the finest scents. In 2021, we\u2019re leaving cucumber- and sweet-pea-based soaps behind. It\u2019s all about them subtle citrus and wood smells.\n\nJS: Subtle citrus and wood smells, the new Rosewood Movement. Got it.\n\n24. \u201cDevil in a New Dress\u201d (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nJS: I once heard you declare this one of Kanye\u2019s worst songs. This is not a widely held position, to put it mildly. Would you care to explain why you feel that way?\n\nCH: The flip of Smokey Robinson\u2019s \u201cWill You Love Me Tomorrow\u201d always bugged me. Every human operates on a certain frequency and that high-pitched, recurring sample grates on my very existence. Kanye is the pied piper of nostalgia. People continuously rate his first three albums as unimpeachable projects he can never surmount, and a lot of that has to do with the soul samples mixed with the faux-conscious raps. Kanye\u2019s two verses on this song are merely fine. Like, y\u2019all are going to sit on Jeff Bezos\u2019s internet and tell me that Kanye rapping, \u201cThe Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme? / That\u2019s \u2018Dior Homme,\u2019 not \u2018Dior, homie,\u2019\u201d really belongs on the Mount Olympus of hip-hop?\n\nThe only saving grace of this song is Rick Ross\u2019s verse, which is immaculate, and even I\u2019m not enough of an asshole to say otherwise.\n\nJS: It\u2019s a good song, Charles. But not sure I\u2019d feel so strongly if it existed only in its G.O.O.D. Friday version, which didn\u2019t include Rozay\u2014or more importantly, that breakdown. For all of the bloated track lengths and proggy ambitions on MBDTF, the middle third of \u201cDevil in a New Dress\u201d remains one of its highlights. The sample and drums drop out, and we\u2019re left with piano, bass, strings, and a heavily-vocoded Kanye. It\u2019s a stunning moment, and I get lost in it every time.\n\n23. \u201cBlame Game\u201d (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nJS: I occasionally visit the r/BrandNewSentence subreddit, where people post \u201csentences never before written, found in the wild.\u201d Recent examples include \u201cMan accused of Ponzi scheme attempts to escape FBI with underwater scooter\u201d and \u201cVictorian baby yeet machine.\u201d I submit that, had this subreddit existed back in 2010, \u201cYou call me motherfucker for long\u201d would\u2019ve been a worthy post because nobody before or since then has ever uttered those words in that order.\n\nBut to the track: Which song off MBDTF has aged the worst, and why is it \u201cBlame Game?\u201d\n\nCH: It\u2019s the misogyny. On a technical level, I don\u2019t mind the John Legend chorus, the somber production, or how it narratively closes out MBDTF, but Kanye\u2019s lyrics and the Chris Rock coda are truly a misstep on an otherwise exceptional album. Kanye often dips into extreme incel territory, and it\u2019s only gotten worse with age. \u201cBlame Game\u201d was a harbinger of what was to come years later on songs like \u201cI Thought About Killing You\u201d or the unreleased \u201cNew Body.\u201d Is there any line that sums up late-stage Kanye and his terrible politics as well as, \u201cYou should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you?\u201d\n\nThe saving grace of \u201cBlame Game\u201d arrives when Kanye finally sheds the toxicity. His voice launches into a falsetto and sounds amateurish next to Legend, but it\u2019s the raw quality that sells the heartbreak at the center of MBDTF. As Kanye repeats the refrain \u201cI can\u2019t love you this much,\u201d it feels like a rare moment when a megastar realizes how brutally celebrity has warped their perception of reality.\n\nJS: I loved this song at the time, and I still love the Aphex Twin sample, but I don\u2019t need this song in my life anymore. Plus, as toxic Kanye breakup songs go, this is no \u201c30 Hours.\u201d \u201cThe only thing open is Waffle House / Girl, don\u2019t start with me\u201d >>>> \u201cNow you noticeable and can\u2019t nobody get control of you.\u201d\n\n Andy Kropa/Getty Images\n\nKanye West and Gwen Stefani at a September 2010 fashion show in New York City\n\nLevel 5: F.I.N.E. Music\n\n22. \u201cDon\u2019t Stop\u201d (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nCH: I was never enamored of Child Rebel Soldier\u2014the kind-of supergroup of Kanye, Pharrell, and Lupe Fiasco. Relistening to \u201cDon\u2019t Stop\u201d 10 years later makes me realize that my teenage taste wasn\u2019t that far off the mark. There was a moment in the 2000s when you could tell Pusha T was penning all of Pharrell\u2019s raps, because out of nowhere the legendary producer would talk about his prowess at cooking and selling drugs. \u201cDon\u2019t Stop\u201d is no different, especially considering it also includes the type of homophobic bars that were all too common in 2010.\n\nJS: Do you think Push wrote Pharrell\u2019s \u201cMove That Dope\u201d verse? And if so, how long do you think it took to convince Skateboard P that \u201cthe Gandalf hat and the weird-ass clothes\u201d was a fire bar?\n\nCH: Push most definitely wrote that verse. There\u2019s no way Pharrell is waking up one day and thinking he should rap, \u201cI know guerrillas with the triggers that\u2019s on a banana clip / And packin\u2019 with the biggest missiles.\u201d\n\nJS: Just another reason Pusha T is one of our finest Americans. If Hillary had picked him over Tim Kaine, we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.\n\n21. \u201cIn for the Kill (Remix)\u201d (La Roux [Gold Edition])\n\nCH: La Roux really needs her flowers. The run she went on in 2009 and 2010 was unmatched. \u201cIn for the Kill\u2019 is the type of rarified pop excellence you just don\u2019t see anymore. Kanye is way too horny for his own good on the remix, which makes sense considering this was during a time when he\u2019d subject everyone to his porn-watching habits in the studio. But the fact that even a horny Kanye couldn\u2019t ruin \u201cIn for the Kill\u201d speaks to its excellence so many years later.\n\nJS: I\u2019m a fan of Kanye\u2019s random appearances on dance songs during this era. (See also: \u201cAmerican Boy\u201d; Stromae\u2019s \u201cAlors on Danse.\u201d) He doesn\u2019t add a ton to these tracks, but it\u2019s a nice time capsule\u2014of where he was in his career and what popular music sounded like before the trap explosion. Sad we never got him on \u201cDanza Kuduro.\u201d\n\n20. \u201cLooking for Trouble\u201d (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nCH: J. Cole and I have a contentious relationship, meaning I tend to dismiss most of his music, and he has no idea I exist. But this is the rare time when I give J. Cole his respect. There\u2019s an old quote washed-up basketball players tell their delusional charges, \u201cLuck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity,\u201d but damn if Cole didn\u2019t take full advantage of this star-making turn on \u201cLooking for Trouble.\u201d As the story goes, J. Cole received the beat for the song the night before Kanye was due to release it, while he was in Kalamazoo, Michigan.\n\n\u201cI got a call from Kanye and he was like, \u2018What\u2019s up? It\u2019s Kanye. Can you get that verse today? I\u2019m tryna put the song out tonight.\u2019 I honestly didn\u2019t think I could do it in time so I told him that,\u201d Cole told Complex in 2010. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019ll wait. We got engineers up all night so you got a while to do it. But if you can, have it done by today.\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019ll make it happen somehow.\u2019 I wrote my verse on the hour-and-a-half ride to Detroit, did the radio promos, left that, went directly to the studio, laid the verse, and sent it to him by 5 o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\nUp to this point, Cole had spent the majority of his career modeling himself after West and you can hear that extreme competitive urge to impress on his closing verse. Cole has always been at his best when he has a clearly defined antagonist and his verse sounds as if he\u2019s asking Ye, \u201cWhy in the hell did you sign Big Sean and Cudi over me?\u201d Throughout his verse, Cole compares himself to Biblical figures and Hov, but it\u2019s when the beat cuts out that he underlines how long he\u2019s waited for this moment. \u201cIronic, you been sleeping on the one that you been dreaming \u2018bout,\u201d he brazenly says to the world. Cole had finally arrived.\n\nJS: My only problem with this: The sample flip immediately reminds me of Cam\u2019ron\u2019s \u201cBubble Music,\u201d even if the production on \u201cLooking for Trouble\u201d is superior. (Equally distracting: CyHi\u2019s verse, which includes the line \u201cI\u2019m Jake Gyllenhaal, I\u2019m in the hood with the bubble.\u201d) But J. Cole is phenomenal here, delivering bars so powerful that Kanye cleared out the beat for him. It can be easy to write Cole off\u2014he can be tedious and condescending, and I will never forgive him for what he did to Jeremih\u2019s \u201cPlanez\u201d\u2014but when he raps like this, it makes you wonder why he\u2019s never been able to cement himself as an all-time great.\n\n19. \u201cErase Me\u201d (Man on the Moon II)\n\nCH: The heathens really wasn\u2019t rocking with \u201cErase Me\u201d back in the day. In fairness, this was the era of the Knux and Chiddy Bang, meaning a bunch of kids reared on Pitchfork\u2019s indie snobbery were making rock-inspired rap groups. Sonically, \u201cErase Me,\u201d fit squarely into this era while aging better than any of its contemporaries. Kid Cudi\u2019s singing is far more vibrant and lively than anything else on the dour Man on the Moon II. The main guitar melody and the explosive drums on the chorus never do too much. Even Kanye tries his best to deliver a rare charming verse about a potential lover before he ruins it with that sweet, sweet Rosewood-era misogyny.\n\nJS: I never fully got the Kid Cudi thing\u2014being born in the early \u201980s will do that to you\u2014but I respect that kids from your generation ride so hard for him. Also, the first Man on the Moon basically plays like a circa-2008 Hype Machine chart, what with the MGMT and Ratatat features and Menahan Street Band samples and Crookers remix. That\u2019s a lot of fun for me, a certified Old. (Though if you want to talk Rosewood-era misogyny, let\u2019s not forget about \u201cMake Her Say.\u201d)\n\n18. \u201cLord Lord Lord\u201d (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nJS: A perfect freebie track. It\u2019s a solid, low-stakes affair with good-not-great verses from Mos Def and Raekwon, and every Charlie Wilson hook should be treasured. (I\u2019m confused about why we had to stretch this out to seven minutes to fit that Swizz verse, though that\u2019s another discussion.) But what I\u2019m most interested in here is the sample: It\u2019s a straight loop of \u201cSolstice,\u201d an obscure 1978 jazz-funk song from Brian Bennett, a British composer best known for his work as a library musician. (That\u2019s a big deal to record-collector nerds.) \u201cSolstice\u201d has improbably become something of a hip-hop staple. It\u2019s been sampled hundreds of times\u2014most notably by Nas, Rick Ross, and the High & the Mighty\u2014and even made its way into songs from Kaytranada and the Mike Patton\u2013Dan the Automator team-up, Lovage. \u201cLord Lord Lord\u201d is one of the better songs to use it. Kanye let \u201cSolstice\u201d breathe, not adding any drums or altering the pitch. Somewhat paradoxically, by doing the least with the sample, \u201cLord Lord Lord\u201d gets the most out of \u201cSolstice.\u201d\n\nCH: You just spilled a lot of ink on an extremely mid G.O.O.D. Friday song. All of the elements of \u201cLord Lord Lord\u201d are fine. Charlie Wilson needs a field\u2019s worth of flowers, so he\u2019ll forever be safe from my ire. The beat isn\u2019t offensive. The various artists arrive with a pulse, but between Kanye saying \u201cI only hang with white boys that like black sluts\u201d and Swizz Beatz dissing bloggers I\u2019m good on this one.\n\n17. \u201cPower (Remix)\u201d (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nJS: When I was a child, one of my favorite songs was Snap\u2019s \u201cThe Power\u201d (which, if you\u2019re unfamiliar, has its own complicated backstory). So when I heard that Kanye was flipping a sample of it into a remix of his \u201cPower\u201d with the help of Swizz Beatz\u2014who was on a streak of turning dance songs into club anthems\u2014I was pretty amped. But the end result is a mixed bag. The Jay-Z verse is fine, as is the opening Kanye verse. (Ye got an assist from Kobe? OK, sure.) Musically, however, there\u2019s a lot going on here. (It\u2019s gettin\u2019 kinda hectic, if you will.) The added synths are another distraction in an already busy beat. And eliminating the King Crimson sample in favor of some 30 Seconds to Mars\u2013core singing isn\u2019t doing it for me. The song comes alive in the second half when the Snap beat drops and Kanye lets loose, but I can\u2019t see anyone picking this over the original.\n\nCH: I have a soft spot in my heart for \u201cPower (Remix).\u201d The song is fine, but I distinctly remember Funk Flex premiering the record on Hot 97 back in the waning years of rappers still bringing their records to the DJ. So for a solid day, I only heard \u201cPower (Remix)\u201d with a bunch of Flex bombs as he marketed the record like it was the most important thing in the world. It was not, young readers, but Flex truly did have that *cough cough* power back in the day. If you don\u2019t believe me go listen to his premiere of \u201cOtis.\u201d\n\n16. \u201cHell of a Life\u201d (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nJS: Dirtbag Kanye has always been one of my favorite Kanyes. The song is a little icky given the Jesus Is King rapper\u2019s admitted porn addiction and his love for his future wife\u2019s, um, filmography, but I\u2019ll take Ye rapping about drugs and weirdo sex over whatever is happening on his past few albums. It\u2019s also a spiritual predecessor to \u201cNo Church in the Wild\u201d or the more interesting parts of Yeezus, like \u201cI Am a God\u201d or \u201cHold My Liquor.\u201d \u201cHell of a Life\u201d sounds a little dated in 2020, but I still mess with it.\n\nCH: This song sounds like a sentient XVideos search bar. The propulsive crunch and dark chaos of \u201cHell of a Life\u201d is so immaculately produced that even horny Kanye can\u2019t ruin this track. In 2016, famous adult actress Lisa Ann claimed that Kanye sent her unsolicited photos of the explicit variety. Combined with the aforementioned porn addiction, \u201cHell of a Life\u201d is a bizarre time capsule. So much of Kanye\u2019s Rosewood era is about an excess of ego, celebrity, and sex that in the following years seemed to spin wildly out of control.\n\n Peter Kramer/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal\n\nKanye West appears on NBC\u2019s Today show in November 2010\n\nLevel 4: G.O.O.D. Music\n\n15. \u201cStart It Up\u201d (The Hunger for More 2)\n\nCH: For a brief but blindingly transcendent moment in 2010, Lloyd Banks was the best rapper alive. It was as if the entire music industry descended upon G-Unit\u2019s second-in-command, determined to turn him into a household name. The DJs at Hot 97 and Power 105 should be arrested for how much they played \u201cBeamer, Benz, or Bentley.\u201d At the dawn of a new decade, every rapper either wanted to be on a song with Lloyd Banks or remix one of his hits. \u201cStart It Up\u201d alone had Swizz Beatz, Kanye West, Ryan Leslie, and Fabolous on it.\n\nThe beautiful thing about \u201cStart It Up\u201d is how obvious it is that Kanye didn\u2019t want to get outrapped by Banks. It\u2019s as if Kanye told all of his ghostwriters to form like Voltron in pursuit of delivering a decent verse. To this day, the line, \u201cThe first album I vomited, the second I colonic\u2019d it / Ain\u2019t nobody fucking with me, I platonic\u2019d it\u201d is as dumb as it is great. JS, how do you feel about Lloyd Banks?\n\nJS: As someone who came of age during the G-Unit mixtape era, I\u2019ve always loved him. He obviously wasn\u2019t a star on the level of 50 Cent, but as rap henchmen go, there have been few better than Banks. (I\u2019m shocked this line didn\u2019t cause Fat Joe to drop dead right on the spot, because it nearly killed me when I heard it.) Also, don\u2019t tell anyone, but I prefer his version of \u201cVictory\u201d to the original.\n\nBanks is one of the best punch-line rappers of his generation, whereas Kanye is just one of the punch-line-iest. Charles, do you have a least favorite Kanye punch line? I have a tough time deciding between \u201cThey be ballin\u2019 in the D-League / I be speakin\u2019 Swaghili\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m a rap-lic priest / Gettin\u2019 head by the nuns.\u201d\n\nCH: 2013\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m In It\u201d is one of my favorite Kanye West songs of all time, but paradoxically contains the two worst Kanye lyrics of all time:\n\nChasin\u2019 love, lots of bittersweet hours lost / Eatin\u2019 Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce\n\nUh, Black girl sippin\u2019 white wine / Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign\n\nKanye rapping about race is bad. Kanye rapping about sex is worse. When you put those two together, you get the above.\n\nJS: We just cited four terrible lines from \u201cI\u2019m in It,\u201d yet we both love the song. Fucking Kanye.\n\n14. \u201cChristmas in Harlem\u201d (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nJS: I thought the perfect Harlem Holiday song already existed before this in \u201cBallin\u2019 on Xmas,\u201d which appeared on Jim Jones\u2019s Dipset Christmas album. But the final version of this song\u2014on which Pusha T turns Santa\u2019s weight into a coke punch line\u2014beats it by a mile. (Predictably, it also features Jim Jones.)\n\nCH: We absolutely needed \u201cChristmas In Harlem\u201d for Cam\u2019ron\u2019s verse alone. There will never be a funnier moment in a Christmas song than Cam closing his verse out with \u201cshouts to the coldest on my barometer / Berkman, Shapiro, Kalina, Hanukkah,\u201d and then ad-libbing \u201cmy lawyers\u201d immediately after. You can\u2019t buy that type of publicity.\n\n13. \u201cSee Me Now\u201d (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nCH: The people don\u2019t deserve \u201cSee Me Now.\u201d When Angie Martinez premiered the record on Hot 97 it was supposed to be such a moment. Kanye assembled Beyonc\u00e9 and Charlie Wilson to collaborate over a cheery Lex Luger and No I.D. beat. Was it obvious that \u201cSee Me Now\u201d was an easy, feel-good track meant to get him back in the peoples\u2019 good graces? Yes. Does that mean it deserved to be yawned at? Hell no. The Charlie hook alone should\u2019ve at least given this song a week at no. 1 on the Hot 100.\n\nJS: You ever think about how Lex Luger defined the sound of rap for two years at the beginning of the last decade and then basically disappeared? Yeah, there was \u201cB.M.F.\u201d and \u201cMC Hammer,\u201d but also \u201cWho Da Neighbors\u201d and all the Waka Flocka table-flippers. Starting around 2013\u2014probably thanks largely to Drake and 40\u2014rap got a little moodier, chillier, and less fantastical. \u201cSee Me Now\u201d isn\u2019t one of those ultra-maximal Lex Luger productions (sounds like No I.D. was in the driver\u2019s seat here), but I wanted to give credit to the man who made \u201c9000 Watts\u201d possible.\n\n12. \u201cSo Appalled\u201d (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nCH: Why the fuck is \u201cSo Appalled\u201d even this high? Get this shit out of here, JS.\n\nJS: I\u2019m legit wondering whether you like this album, or Kanye, or music in general. \u201cSo Appalled\u201d is great for so many reasons: the beat, the Pusha verse, CyHi\u2019s \u201cTrojan in the pocket / Matt Leinart\u201d double entendre, the Swizz chorus, RZA\u2019s pronunciation of \u201cfuckin\u2019 ridiculous.\u201d What\u2019s the matter, Otter? You got Bobby Brown jaw?\n\nCH: I don\u2019t hate \u201cSo Appalled,\u201d but it always felt like it should have stayed a G.O.O.D. Friday loosie. It\u2019s not a terrible song, but it\u2019s also a song that\u2019s extremely fat around the edges. For those who have forgotten, \u201cSo Appalled\u201d clocks in at almost seven minutes. It\u2019s not even the best posse cut on the album, despite being longer than \u201cAll of the Lights,\u201d \u201cMonster,\u201d and \u201cGorgeous.\u201d\n\n11. Monster (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nJS: Charles, I want to discuss something you broke down on The Ringer Music Show: the fact that Kanye almost left \u201cMonster\u201d off My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy because Nicki outshined him. First, how incredibly on-brand. Second, do you think that decision was a Sliding Doors moment? What would we have missed out on had \u201cMonster\u201d been trapped in YouTube videos and MediaFire links?\n\nCH: For Nicki Minaj, \u201cMonster\u201d always felt like a Kobayashi Maru. The once-in-a-generation verse was the final spark that Minaj needed to go from a talented member of Lil Wayne\u2019s nascent Young Money crew to the subject of full-fledged debates about whether she was a top-five rapper in the world (spoiler alert: she was). Unfortunately, \u201cMonster\u201d was an artistic peak for Nicki, one that she\u2019s still chasing. She became a better lyricist and artist in later years, but \u201cMonster\u201d was the last time it felt like Minaj had to serve only one genre. When \u201cSuper Bass\u201d hit, the trajectory of her career changed. Being a household name that appears on Ellen is wildly different from being the subject of debates raging in the 2Dopeboyz comment section. If \u201cMonster\u201d hadn\u2019t made My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, it\u2019d still be worshipped, but it also might have ensured Minaj\u2019s career trajectory was a tad more gradual.\n\nJS: I think she reached her full potential in 2014, around the time of Pinkprint, when she was at her pop apex all while dropping truly great verses on \u201cNo Flex Zone,\u201d \u201cLookin\u2019 Ass,\u201d and her version of \u201cDanny Glover.\u201d It\u2019s been a steady decline for her since, partly because of self-sabotage and partly because rap treats its female stars like garbage once it finds someone to replace them.\n\nMy next question: Jay-Z\u2019s overall r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is unimpeachable, but he\u2019s certainly lost some luster in the past 15 years. His verse on this song in particular gets clowned frequently. Charles, do you think his eh turn on \u201cMonster\u201d changed how we think about Hov? In other words: Love\u2014does late-period Jay get enough of it, too much of it, or just the right amount of it?\n\nCH: It\u2019s critical reevaluation time. Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cMonster\u201d verse is comically bad, but also it\u2019s charming that the Marcy rapper who bragged about losing 92 bricks would spend the beginning of the 2010s rapping about Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness, Goblin, ghouls, and zombies who are devoid of a conscience. Later-stage Jay-Z albums (e.g., Magna Carta Holy Grail, 4:44) could have used more spooky bars.\n\n Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nAl Jardine Kanye West at the \u201cWe Are the World 25 Years for Haiti\u201d recording session held on February 1, 2010, in Hollywood\n\nLevel 3: G.R.E.A.T. Music\n\n10. \u201cLive Fast, Die Young\u201d (Teflon Don)\n\nCH: This song wasn\u2019t originally intended for Rick Ross\u2019s 2010 classic, Teflon Don, but was made during the MBDTF sessions. The James Brown \u201cFunky President\u201d and Rick James \u201cMary Jane (Live)\u201d samples that punctuate the beat are the same one\u2019s Kanye would play with across his fifth studio album. The horns lifted from the Bar-Kay\u2019s \u201cIf This World Were Mine\u201d sound so grandiose you can tell Island Def Jam paid a hefty check to get everything cleared.\n\nBut \u201cLive Fast, Die Young\u201d always felt like it was of the Rosewood era without neatly fitting into the MBDTF narrative. Ross\u2019s verses are too celebratory. Kanye is having the time of his life, despite trying to put on a repentant facade. Even the Chicago rapper\u2019s verse spit directly in the face of his detractors. When Kanye raps, \u201cI\u2019m back by unpopular demand / Least he still poppin\u2019 in Japan, shoppin\u2019 in Milan / Hoppin\u2019 out the van, screams from the fans / \u2018Yeezy, always knew you\u2019d be on top again,\u2019\u201d it\u2019s not only hilarious, but a rare moment that reaffirmed Kanye\u2019s one-of-a-kind ego was healing nicely.\n\nJS: There\u2019s allegedly an unreleased Hype Williams\u2013directed video for this song. It\u2019s a damn-near crime that we never got Hype to shoot a video for Rozay while the big man was at the peak of his powers. If I ever get my hands on a time machine, I\u2019m dropping 2010 Rick Ross in 1998 and telling Hype to turn on the fish-eyed lens and give us the $10 million video the Teflon Don deserved.\n\n9. \u201cPower\u201d (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nJS: On The Ringer Music Show, you spoke to S1, a then-unknown producer who had given a beat CD to longtime Kanye confidant Rhymefest. On it was the skeleton for \u201cPower\u201d\u2014it had the chanted sample and the Cold Grits drums, but not much else, right? Kanye hears it, gets S1 on the first plane to Hawaii, and they begin to figure out how to make this beat worthy of Ye\u2019s comeback album. First comes the King Crimson sample, next comes the bass and guitars courtesy of Mike Dean, then the keyboards by Dean and Jeff Bhasker. Eventually, they\u2019d add a goddamn cello. The end result is so full, so booming, and so triumphant that it lives on as an arena anthem and soundtrack to terrible movie trailers a decade later.\n\nThat is the genius of Kanye beginning with this era: In the early Roc-a-Fella and College Dropout days, he mainly crafted beats in isolation. During the Late Registration and Graduation days, he began adding orchestral flourishes and collaborating with outside producers, but it was still mostly whatever came out of his MPC. But by My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, he had an army of producers and musicians at his disposal. The individual pieces were great on their own\u2014I\u2019m sure I would\u2019ve enjoyed the original S1 beat had it ended up on a Rhymefest album\u2014but under Kanye\u2019s direction, all the parts came together into something indelible. And that\u2019s power.\n\nCH: \u201cPower\u201d is such an awkward song. There\u2019s so much going on, from the chants to the King Crimson sample. The beat is so staccato at times that Kanye clearly struggles to fit all of his thoughts within its parameter. For a clear example, look no further than the couplet, \u201cYou short-minded niggas\u2019 thoughts is Napoleon / My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in.\u201d But none of that ends up mattering. \u201cPower\u201d is more about setting a tone for an era than the pursuit of perfection. There\u2019s a reason the song became movie trailer fodder over the next decade\u20142010\u2019s The Social Network, 2011\u2019s Limitless, 2017\u2019s Power Rangers, 2017\u2019s All the Money in the World. The power of \u201cPower\u201d is how well it denotes a sense of triumph before Kanye ever utters a word. It\u2019s a feat of Kanye West as a producer more than a showcase for his talents as a rapper. Anyone can tell you they\u2019re powerful. It\u2019s another thing to make you feel it.\n\n8. \u201cG.O.O.D. Friday\u201d (G.O.O.D. Fridays)\n\nJS: This song, more than any other, makes me sad that we never got a G.O.O.D. Music compilation aside from Cruel Summer, which I remember now only for \u201cNew God Flow\u201d and stray shots fired at Kris Humphries and George Tenet. (2012, baby!) But \u201cG.O.O.D. Friday,\u201d the eponymous track from the legendary free-release series that dominated the second half of 2010, is a perfect showcase for what Kanye and his cohorts do best. There\u2019s the beat, with pounding drums and a familiar sample flipped in a way you\u2019d never heard it before. Uncle Charlie breathes life into the hook. Cudi\u2019s crooning is a wonderful accent. Pusha and Big Sean deliver; latter-day Common even acquits himself nicely. A good time all around and, sadly, a track that could never be made today.\n\nCH: So much of the music that was made during the \u201cRosewood\u201d era seemed engineered as peak critical bait. The samples were either obscure or ridiculously expensive. Every song needed an extended outro. Legendary producers were called in as vibe connoisseurs. It made for a near perfect album, but often that meant there was little room for something that was simply fun. \u201cG.O.O.D. Friday\u201d never seeks to do too much. Kid Cudi is on hook duty and offers a couple well-placed hums. Pusha T raps about his one true love, selling cocaine. Big Sean drops some goofy punch lines. G.O.O.D. Music may not have been the most lucrative rapper imprint of the 2010s (that\u2019s Young Money), but it was easily the most cohesive.\n\n Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nJay-Z and Kanye West perform at Yankee Stadium on September 13, 2010 in New York City\n\nLevel 2: C.L.A.S.S.I.C. Music\n\n7. \u201cRun This Town\u201d (Blueprint 3)\n\nJS: Blueprint 3 produced two of Jay-Z\u2019s biggest commercial hits, including \u201cRun This Town,\u201d which is great. (The other, \u201cEmpire State of Mind\u201d was his first no. 1 single; it\u2019s terrible.) But by the time BP3 was released in September 2009, it had become clear that Ye, who had just dropped four straight classic albums, had surpassed Big Brother, who was in the middle of an uneven post-\u201cretirement\u201d stretch. The gap between the two only widened over the next few years, as Jay receded while the fire within Kanye grew\u2014we hear it in Jay\u2019s two MBDTF verses, while 2011\u2019s Watch the Throne is mostly a Kanye showcase. \u201cRun This Town\u201d marked the second time Jay had ever put a Kanye verse on one of his albums, following The Blueprint 2\u2019s \u201cThe Bounce.\u201d But in 2002, Ye was an upstart still two years away from The College Dropout; he was a young producer trying to rap, not the megawatt multi-hyphenate we\u2019ve come to alternately love and detest. Seven years after \u201cThe Bounce,\u201d \u201cRun This Town\u201d presented Jay and Kanye as equals, which makes it something of an unofficial passing of the torch.\n\nKanye has had many understudies. Two have been successful\u2014Cudi, who has a complicated history with his mentor, and Travis Scott, who let Drake threaten to hunt Ye down on \u201cSicko Mode.\u201d Charles, why do you think Kanye never inspired a true successor like Jay inspired him?\n\nCH: Kanye\u2019s ego has always stopped him from truly minting an heir apparent. There\u2019s a reason Drake\u2019s verse didn\u2019t make \u201cAll of the Lights,\u201d J.Cole was relegated to a G.O.O.D. Friday track, and Nicki Minaj\u2019s scene-stealing moment on \u201cMonster\u201d almost caused Ye to take the song off MBDTF. Kanye is a supreme opportunist. He\u2019ll collaborate with anyone that can help him sell more records or gain some type of cultural cachet, but the minute that artist shows a sign of surpassing him, tension arises. We\u2019ve seen that Lil Wayne had no problem with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s (Drake, Nicki, and kind of Tyga) becoming more popular than him. In a similar way, Gucci Mane is responsible for putting on rappers like Migos and Young Thug. On the other hand, when Kanye sees rappers like Drake, Cole, Chance the Rapper, and Travis Scott updating his playbook, there\u2019s something within him that won\u2019t let him recede.\n\n6. \u201cAll of the Lights\u201d / \u201cAll of the Lights (Interlude)\u201d\n\nJS: You spend a lot of time breaking this song down on the podcast. I would recommend people go there to listen to the story of the making of \u201cAll of the Lights\u201d and how Ye got the most left-field guest of the entire album and why Drake doesn\u2019t appear on the final version. So instead of rehashing that, I want to ask an important question: Which of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\u2019s five covers was your favorite?\n\nCH: The George Condo painting of Kanye wearing a crown with his head impaled by a sword was a very on-the-nose metaphor, but it always seemed the most apt. There\u2019s a reason it was Kanye\u2019s Twitter avatar for the longest time. Kanye\u2019s identity is molded by this idea of being the one. Over the years, Kanye\u2019s transitioned from rapping about Jesus (2004\u2019s \u201cJesus Walks\u201d) to proclaiming he\u2019s a God throughout 2013\u2019s Yeezus. Back in 2010, Condo\u2019s illustrated sword seemed like a symbol of public perception killing West. In retrospect, the deadly sword was always wielded by Kanye and he\u2019d forever be doomed to fall upon it.\n\nJS: Ten years ago, I would have also picked that one. (That\u2019s the version of the CD I bought back when we still bought CDs.) Today, however, I\u2019m a fan of the naked sphinx straddling a beer-clutching Kanye. It was banned by Walmart and the iTunes Store at the time. Shockingly, it\u2019s the version Spotify uses, even though it\u2019s pixelated on our parent company\u2019s platform. Condo was disgusted by the censorship: \u201cThe superimposition of people\u2019s perceptions on a cartoon is shocking,\u201d he said in 2010. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in their minds should be banned. Not the painting.\u201d Amen.\n\n5. \u201cLost in the World\u201d / \u201cWho Will Survive in America\u201d (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nJS: Why do you think Kanye brought Justin Vernon into his orbit over the hundred other popular indie musicians circa 2010? Why Bon Iver and not, say, Grizzly Bear?\n\nCH: Because Justin Vernon is interesting and sounds like an angel, while Grizzly Bear is boring outside of that one time Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 went to go see them live and Pitchfork had a field day blogging about it.\n\nJS: Do you have a favorite Bon Iver song? Personally, I break out \u201cBlood Bank\u201d whenever the weather dips below 40 degrees.\n\nCH: 2016\u2019s \u201c715 - CR\u03a3\u03a3KS,\u201d is the peak of Justin Vernon\u2019s powers. On the surface the 22, A Million song is so ugly. There\u2019s no beat for Vernon to hide behind. All the audience can listen to is this android-like voice that\u2019s so mangled and tortured you can\u2019t help but want to save it.\n\nVernon is a once-in-a-lifetime talent who came of age as the internet and technology was beginning to reshape the way we connected with the sound of the human voice. Vernon, along with T-Pain and Future, was able to summon this paradoxical feeling of technology\u2019s creeping coldness and endless ambition through the way he contorted his voice with Auto-Tune, reverb, and a flurry of other engineering techniques. Kanye was able to introduce Vernon to the wider world on songs like \u201cLost in the World,\u201d but it was on \u201c715 - CR\u03a3\u03a3KS\u201d that years of experimentation was finally perfected.\n\nJS: Sadly, we\u2019ll probably never get another JV-Kanye collab, because he, like most of us, can no longer kick it with Kanye.\n\n Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nKanye West performs at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards\n\nLevel 1: P.E.R.F.E.C.T.

Fridays)\n\nCH: The greatest tragedy of modern pop music is that \u201cChristian Dior Denim Flow\u201d didn\u2019t make My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Several tracks could have been sacrificed to give it a spot\u2014\u201cSo Appalled,\u201d \u201cDevil in a New Dress,\u201d \u201cBlame Game.\u201d Kanye\u2019s hormones get the best of him as he wastes a truly transcendent beat trying to slide into the DMs of every model that was working in 2010. Kid Cudi\u2019s amateurish voice expertly melds with John Legend\u2019s classically trained vocals as they lament being at the peak of their powers and still calling that same ex back. JS, why is \u201cChristian Dior Denim Flow\u201d the greatest song of all time?\n\nJS: It\u2019s the most inspirational song I can think of named after luxury clothing. But it\u2019s the melody, and the drums programming, and that chorus, and that switch-up in the back half. But I go a different direction than you\u2014this song is better than three-fourths of MBDTF, but it just doesn\u2019t fit the album\u2019s vibe to me. It doesn\u2019t fully capture the tortured-genius energy he wanted to project in this era. And it\u2019s clear Kanye was in part trying to make a cohesive statement rather than just a collection of the best songs to come of the sessions. The tragedy here is that we never got to hear a fully mixed and mastered version of \u201cChristian Dior Denim Flow.\u201d (Again, this is why we needed another, better G.O.O.D. Music compilation. Can we at least get these G.O.O.D Friday tracks on streaming in 2021? How is \u201cLift Yourself\u201d on Spotify but this song isn\u2019t?!?!)\n\nAlso: Predictably, I love the Pusha verse. But there\u2019s someone on the track who clearly outspits him.\n\nCH: \u201cChristian Dior Denim Flow\u201d is home to two of the best verses spit by best-rapper-alive candidates in 2010. When Kanye tweeted, \u201cYo man Lloyd Banks prolly the most underrated MC in the game...Man he deserve to be top 5 at least,\u201d it wasn\u2019t hyperbole. At the height of the rap-blog boom, Lloyd Banks had returned with a vengeance. G-Unit\u2019s second-in-command was an unstoppable force with the entire music industry seemingly backing his ascent. The Hunger for More 2 would drop the same day as My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and provide a gritty foil to Kanye\u2019s baroque sonic banquet. Nevertheless, hearing Banks deliver a truly perfect verse opener like \u201cUgh, handcraft material, champagne for cereal / Shorty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm\u201d is still jaw dropping a decade later. The little puking ad-lib he delivers after he raps, \u201cBall like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Ugh!)\u201d belongs in the MoMA. Throughout Banks\u2019s all-too-short verse, his voice sounds like it was run through that woodchipper in Fargo and that is the ultimate compliment.\n\nJS: I want nothing more than to listen to a Jadakiss\u2013Lloyd Banks podcast. (Spotify, make it happen.) But who was the other best-rapper-alive candidate in 2010? You can make an argument for Kanye, but I suspect you\u2019re thinking someone else \u2026\n\nCH: Scott Mescudi was the only rapper coming close to matching Banks on \u201cChristian Dior Denim Flow.\u201d By late 2010, Cudi was months removed from everyone in hip-hop thinking he was ingesting liquid cocaine (not a real thing). So how does he approach the haters? Well, he summons the spirit of one of the greatest rappers of all time. \u201cHey ya, I\u2019m on my Andr\u00e9 3000,\u201d he raps toward the conclusion of the song. \u201cI\u2019m all good now, a nigga don\u2019t need no counseling.\u201d Kid Cudi would eventually need counseling, but for a fleeting moment he made us all believe one could be healed through the power of immaculate rapping on Kanye West loosies.\n\n3. \u201cDark Fantasy\u201d (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nCH: The best Kanye albums generally begin with a thesis statement.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t supposed to make it past 25 / Joke\u2019s on you we still alive\u201d \u2014The College Dropout\n\n\u201cOh, he\u2019ll give us what we need / It may not be what we want\u201d \u2014Yeezus\n\n\u201cCan we get much higher?\u201d \u2014My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\n\nAfter Nicki Minaj\u2019s cute but unnecessary nursery rhyme, Teyana Taylor and Justin Vernon arrive like oracles to set the stage. It\u2019s a rhetorical question, but it\u2019s also a sign of West picking his shot. One could argue from a craft standpoint that Kanye never reached the heights of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy again, and it all begins with \u201cDark Fantasy.\u201d\n\nJS: Back when I used to DJ (I\u2019ve lived many lives, Charles), I\u2019d often break this song out about 10 minutes before close, when everyone was good and drunk and ready to fuck, fight, or cry. I\u2019d loop the instrumental break that comes between the intro and the verse and immediately start blending in one of my true closing songs (the \u201cKilling Me Softly\u201d drums sound pretty good under it). For a beautiful 20 seconds before I\u2019d kick to the next track, the entire club would scream along to \u201cCan we get much higher?\u201d For a fleeting moment, the answer, for me, just like Kanye, was a resounding no.\n\n2. \u201cGorgeous\u201d (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nCH: In 2010, only Kid Cudi could make singing about celebrity anxiety sound like a Greek tragedy. Over an epic guitar riff, Cudi\u2019s slightly distorted voice wails:\n\nNot for nothing, I\u2019ve foreseen it, I dreamed it\nI can feel it slowly drifting away from me\nNo more chances, if you blow this, you bogus\nI will never ever let you live this down, down, down\n\nIn those four bars, Kanye and his G.O.O.D. Music associates sum up My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\u2019s entire reason for being. Not only was Kanye\u2019s fame slipping away in 2010, but there was an acute sense that perfecting his next album was the only way he could surmount the very people who would \u201cnever ever\u201d let him live his interruption of Swift down. So when Kanye launches into the first verse it\u2019s a clear sink-or-swim moment.\n\nJS: There\u2019s so much to love about \u201cGorgeous,\u201d from the hook to the beat to Raekwon. But what stands out 10 years later is the elegance of Kanye\u2019s verses, which says a lot considering he fires a bar at Matt Stone and Trey Parker. It\u2019s some of the best pure rapping he\u2019s ever committed to wax, with intricate rhyme patterns and thought-provoking couplets masking his seething fury. Topically, it\u2019s high-minded stuff. We make a lot of how My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was an attempt to get himself back in the public\u2019s good graces following the Taylor Swift incident. But when you consider the racial component of the backlash he faced, using the second track on the album to explore race, class, and policing is fairly brave. A lot of credit is likely owed to Malik Yusef, Rhymefest, and the other writers that helped him through \u201cGorgeous,\u201d but the verses are ultimately unmistakably Kanye. And they\u2019re among the best of his career.\n\n1. \u201cRunaway\u201d (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\nCH: Without \u201cRunaway,\u201d there\u2019s no My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. The song exists on multiple poles of existence\u2014sparse and maximalist, tortured and pompous, noxious and rehabilitative. \u201cRunaway\u201d begins with now-iconic piano stabs that echo hauntingly in the ether before they\u2019re confronted by the shamanic voices of Rick James and James Brown. The genesis of \u201cRunaway\u201d was a seemingly thrown-away idea by Emile Haynie. \u201cI had a beat, and I played it, and it was the foundation of \u2018Runaway,\u2019\u201d Haynie told Complex in 2011. \u201cIt was pretty different from the production now, but something about it, the chord progression or the way I put together the chords must\u2019ve rung out to him.\u201d Kanye was likely drawn to the chance to have an emotional canvas to purge himself of the VMA and Taylor Swift incident that had utterly destroyed his pop career.\n\nJS: Kanye was the asshole, the douchebag, the scumbag. But I remember watching the VMA performance live and rooting for him. It was so pretentious\u2014with the ballerinas, a salmon-suited Pusha T, and Ye\u2019s MPC at the center of it, like a pulpit\u2014but you had to admire the ambition. Watching it today, I still get chills when the beat drops and the Rick James sample echoes. It\u2019s also important that the lyrics\u2014the chorus, in particular\u2014acknowledged his standing at the time. Here he was, one year after the Taylor Swift incident, on the same stage, essentially saying, \u201cYeah, I know you hate me, but what I\u2019m offering you is so great, I\u2019m going to make you love me again.\u201d You could feel public sentiment bending back toward him in real time.\n\nWe are, of course, at a similar place with Kanye as we were heading into those VMAs. The past four years have been fraught. The quality of his music has declined. He\u2019s palled around with Trump. He publicly wrestled with his mental health. He\u2019s made bone-headed comments about race. He launched a failed presidential bid. These days, the Kanye experience is exhausting. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a \u201cRunaway\u201d moment that could change that, though I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be capable of providing one even if one could. Still, it\u2019s hard not to put on this song today and recall the time when we were cheering for him to change how we felt about him. That he pulled it off may have been his most impressive feat in a career littered with many.\n\nCH: I totally agree. It\u2019s something Kanye\u2019s frequent collaborator Malik Yusef told us during The Ringer Music Show. \u201cThey love what he presents to the world. And I think he was very self-deprecating in saying, \u2018I\u2019m an asshole. I\u2019m bad. I\u2019m terrible.\u2019 But people took it tongue-in-cheek because they don\u2019t believe it, because the art says that you\u2019re great,\u201d Yusef said. \u201cI think that when he did \u2018Runaway from me baby. I\u2019m trouble.\u2019 And we know what that does. That makes people say, \u2018Well let me solve you.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe vocoder outro of \u201cRunaway\u201d is one of the most heart-wrenching moments of the past decade in popular music. It sonically communicates this primal sense of fear\u2014fear of oneself, fear of what your actions have wrought, fear that you\u2019ll never be able to reclaim what you once had. In essence, that\u2019s always been and will always be Kanye\u2019s singular gift and the root of his continuous downfall.\n",
