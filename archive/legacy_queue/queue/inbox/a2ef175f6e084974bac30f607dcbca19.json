      "Title": "12 Los Angeles Photographers to Follow on Instagram The Points Guy",
      "Selection": "The City of Angels has always been pegged as a dream destination for world travelers. It was named the sixth-most instagrammed city in 2016 \u2014 an indicator of its 21st century popularity \u2014 and as a testament to its status as one of the world\u2019s great cultural destinations, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) just named Los Angeles\u00a0as the host city of an upcoming Olympic Games.\n\nBut not everyone has the time \u2014 or the points and miles \u2014 to travel there, so if you haven\u2019t yet planned your beach vacation or are waiting for the summer season to cool off before heading to Disneyland, we have some some amazing Instagram photographers to satiate your LA travel appetite.\n\n1. @nathanielwood\n\nPhotographer Nathaniel Wood has the inside scoop on what\u2019s new and happening, inviting outsiders to take a look at the city through his lens with a mixture of landscape and portrait photos. His subjects? The quintessential LA trifecta: sun, celebrities and people who want to be celebrities.\n\n2. @killthecity\n\nNick Rufo, another Angeleno photographer, loves his city and wants others to see its beauty. His style \u2014 he shoots mainly landscapes and the occasional portrait \u2014 has drawn its fair share of fans and he\u2019s amassed over 10,000 followers, with photos ranging from angelic blue skies and skyscrapers to portraits of up-and-coming rappers and skateboarders.\n\n3. @john.logic\n\nA 21-year-old SoCal native, John Logic has been taking photos for just over two years. He acknowledges that he isn\u2019t the only photographer in the world, so he\u2019s always finding ways to differentiate himself. Having always had a passion for art, he carefully chooses the time of day, weather and personality of each thing that he photographs. Seriously, it\u2019s quite an amazing feat to make rush hour in downtown LA look like a hospitable place.\n\n4. @tiffanysbell\n\nFor Tiffany Bell, photography was just a minor interest in her life, but it eventually snowballed into a career. Through her work, she has taken photos of just about everything \u2014 from cities, humans, animals, nature and landscapes to interiors, exteriors, food and cocktails. She says\u00a0photography taught her to \u201clook at the ordinary and find the extraordinary\u201d and it\u2019s true \u2014 she\u2019s managed to make gray skyscrapers and dark alleyways look like art in her shots.\n\n5. @laurenlemon\n\nHave you ever wanted to jump into a photo? That\u2019s what LA photographer Lauren Lemon makes us want to do with her rainbow-colored Instagram feed. She uses her art to bring people together and has even promoted public art projects \u2014 like photographing a row of houses that had been painted pink due to an impending demolition.\n\n6. @dylan.schwartz\n\nDylan Schwartz is a creative director, photographer and director who has been named one of city\u2019s best Instagrammers by Los Angeles\u00a0Magazine and has worked with brands like Google, Austrian Airlines and Starwood hotels.\u00a0That\u2019s probably why his photos seem like they\u2019re straight out of a movie; he\u2019s gone to the extreme to get some of his shots, having flown in helicopters to get the perfect angle of the LA skyline.\n\n7. @dayzdandconfuzd\n\nDavid Ingraham\u2019s first camera was a Kodak Pocket Instamatic. A professional musician by trade, he spends his free time with his current camera of choice: an iPhone. His black-and-white photographs of people walking through various LA neighborhoods make it feel like you\u2019re stepping back in time, but don\u2019t be fooled: his most recent \u2018gram was taken this month.\n\n8. @lifeserial\n\nMatt Allard is a writer living in Los Angeles and in his free time, he likes to document his life through photos. In fact, he\u2019s gotten so good at his craft that businesses have partnered with him for ad campaigns. His primary focus is lifestyle photography, and his love for food and coffee is evident in the well-documented caf\u00e9 visits on his feed.\n\n9. @kimgenevieve\n\nOriginally from Canada, Kim Genevieve is a lifestyle and commercial photographer based in La La Land.\u00a0Her unique aesthetic is comprised of bright color palettes and outdoor settings. It\u2019s clear this transplant knows how to blend in with the locals \u2014 you\u2019ll find beaches, colorful food and lots of palm trees populating her Instagram feed.\n\n10. @asteryx\n\nNot much is known about the man behind the photos other than the fact that they\u2019re amazing and his name is Terry. His tool of choice for tackling aerial photo shoots are drones, but when he\u2019s on the ground he\u2019ll frame single subjects at the center of unique backdrops \u2014 like the\u00a0urban light art exhibition located at\u00a0LACMA.\n\n11. @danorst\n\nBy day, Dan Marker-Moore works as a freelancer in the motion graphics industry, doing design and animation, but when work ends, he polishes his skills in photography and videography. He\u2019s captured beautifully composed images of L.A.\u2019s sun-kissed skyline using drones and time-lapse photography to reveal the Milky Way galaxy.\n\n12. @maxwanger\n\nPer his bio, Max Wanger built his first camera out of paper at age seven, and\u00a0his photography skills have only blossomed since. His feed consists of palm trees, sunlight and water sports \u2014 key LA icons. Pair that with adorable photographs of his children, and you\u2019ll never want to scroll away.\n\nAre there any other LA-based photographers on Instagram that you love?
