      "Selection": "Whether you vault over the\u00a0Arctic or soar for hours over the blues of the Pacific Ocean, transpacific flights can be a chore \u2014 yes, even for AvGeeks. Not only are some of these flights among the\u00a0longest in aviation, crossing the international date line wreaks havoc with your sense of time.\n\nBut if you plan your flights right, the next time work or play takes you from the US to various points in Asia, Australia, New Zealand (and back again), it\u2019s a great excuse for a stopover in\u00a0Hawaii. Here\u2019s how to make the international date line work\u00a0for\u00a0you, instead of against you.\n\n1. It Breaks Up a (Really, Really) Long Flight\n\nThe best part of adding a Hawaiian stopover to your return\u00a0flight? You turn one\u00a0loooooooong\u00a0flight into two shorter and more manageable ones. As a bonus, those segments also usually mean more miles accrued overall \u2014 definitely a win-win.\n\nParticularly for East Coasters heading to Australia and New Zealand, the Hawaii stopover is a game changer. Getting to Sydney (SYD) from a New York City-area airport, for example, may involve a six-hour transcontinental flight followed by a 15-hour international flight.\n\nInstead of slogging through the reverse on your return, when you book a multi-segment trip via Qantas \u2014\u00a0which offers five flights per week from Sydney to Honolulu (HNL) and will earn you Oneworld points\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the flights look something like this: SYD to HNL (overnight, nine and a half hours), followed by a Hawaii stopover followed by HNL to LAX (five and a half hours), followed by LAX to New York (another five and a half hours).\n\nSimilar multi-segment itineraries can be booked on Air New Zealand, which offers daily flights from Auckland (AKL) to Honolulu (and will earn you Star Alliance miles).\n\n2. Honolulu Is a Gateway Hub\n\nWhile we tend to think of Hawaii as a destination in and of itself, Honolulu\u2019s Daniel K. Inouye International Airport is a major gateway to the US from destinations further east and south, as well as for flights inbound from the US mainland, so it\u2019s actually an ideal stopover destination.\n\nAccording to the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau, between April and June 2019 alone, there were 780,336 scheduled seats, representing 2,916 flights inbound for Hawaii that crossed the international date line \u2014 which breaks down to more than 200 flights per week on a total of 16 carriers with flights from Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, South Korea, China, Taiwan and Fiji.\n\nHawaiian Airlines alone has 42 fights a week inbound for Honolulu that jump the date line, including daily flights from Sydney and Osaka, Japan (KIX); 11 flights per week from Tokyo Haneda (HND); five flights per week from Seoul, South Korea (ICN); and three flights weekly from Brisbane, Australia (BNE), Auckland, New Zealand (AKL) and Hokkaido, Japan (CTS). The airline also offers three flights weekly from Tokyo Haneda to Kona, Hawaii (KOA).\n\nHawaii\u2019s Halona Blowhole near Honolulu is a great place to check out on your layover.

Speaking of Hawaiian Airlines \u2026\n\nThough Hawaiian Airlines doesn\u2019t have an official stopover promotion in place, such as those offered by Turkish Airlines or Qatar Airways that include accommodations on the ground, Hawaiian Airlines flyers going to or from the airline\u2019s nine international destinations can get a free stopover in Honolulu on each leg, whether outbound or return, if they use the multi-city option when booking on Hawaiian\u2019s website.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the key travel hack here: Booking a multi-city or multi-segment trip lets you design a flight itinerary that includes 24, 48, 72 hours or more on the ground in Hawaii on your return for a minimal difference in cost. Think of it as a two-for-one vacation.\n\nBefore you make the long haul to Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach, be sure to book your stop over in Hawaii for a multi-segment trip.

You Can Fly ANA\u2019s New A380\n\nOther major news for Hawaii (and all the more reason to connect through Honolulu en route to Tokyo): On May 24, ANA\u2019s first Airbus A380 made its debut on thrice-weekly service between Tokyo\u2019s Narita Airport (NRT) and Honolulu. When the carrier\u2019s second A380 entered service on July 1, ANA began offering 10 roundtrip flights per week on the brand-new planes \u2014 an AvGeek\u2019s dream indeed.\n\n\u201cWe already have strong demand for the Tokyo-Honolulu route \u2014 not only among couples [and] honeymooners, but also families, high-end customers, group tours and a wide variety of customers,\u201d an ANA spokesperson said. \u201cWe believe that the A380 will be instrumental in expanding our resort strategy as we seek to increase our market share by doubling the number of seats connecting Honolulu and Tokyo.\u201d\n\n5. It\u2019s a Cure for Jet Lag \u2026 Kind Of\n\nAnd finally we come to jet lag \u2014 or the relative lack thereof. By time of day (morning, midday, afternoon, evening), Honolulu is likely significantly more in line with your Asia-Pacific point of departure than your home time zone, wherever that may be. The major difference here is that Hawaii lies on the opposite side of the international date line.\n\nFor example: 7:44am Friday in Sydney is 11:44am Thursday in Honolulu, while 7:10am Saturday in Tokyo is 12:10pm on Friday. New Zealand is a whole 22 hours ahead of Hawaii by time zones, so 8:49am Friday in Auckland is 10:49am in Honolulu \u2014 yes, the day before. Departing on an overnight flight from any of these destinations, you land in Honolulu in the morning hours \u2014 on the same day you left.\n\nIt\u2019s basically \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d set in paradise.",
