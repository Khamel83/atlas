      "Title": "Meet the Man Who\u2019s Flown 18 Million Miles on United The Points Guy",
      "Selection": "If you\u2019ve ever flown over 100,000 miles in a single year, you\u2019re in elite company. Over 200,000 miles and you\u2019re definitely a top-tier road warrior. But how many people have flown over one million miles in a single year?\n\nTom Stuker has. Twice. And he\u2019s on pace to do it again in 2017.\n\nUnited\u2019s number-one flyer recently passed a major milestone when he reached\u00a0over 18 million total miles \u2014 all on United flights. That\u2019s not 18 million redeemable miles; that\u2019s 18 million flown miles. As in \u201cbutt in seat\u201d miles.\n\nUnited celebrated Tom Stuker\u2019s 18 million flown miles at the Polaris lounge in Chicago today\u00a0with his family and United employees.\nStuker spoke to The Points Guy as the airline\u00a0prepared to celebrate his\u00a0accomplishment with a gathering of his family and United employees\u00a0at the Polaris lounge in Chicago (ORD)\u00a0held earlier today.\n\n\u201cMy first United flight was 1970 or \u201971,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my first commercial flight ever, from Chicago to San Antonio. We dropped about 500 feet at one point \u2014 no one was hurt but for a first-time flyer I was scared a little bit.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Stuker said he had a fear of flying for the first 10 years he spent in the air. Eventually, he realized if it\u2019s your time to go, it\u2019s your time to go.\u00a0\u201cI used to get antsy if I had to fly for two weeks,\u201d said Stuker. \u201cNow I\u00a0get antsy if I\u2019m\u00a0on the ground for two weeks.\u201d\n\nWhile he\u2019s never had a serious issue\u00a0in the air, he\u2019s experienced a few on-board incidents. \u201cI\u2019ve never been on a flight where the masks came down, but\u00a0I\u2019ve been\u00a0on an aborted takeoff and an aborted landing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been on three different flights where someone died. One of the guys, I was talking to him, then he went to sleep and never woke up.\u201d\n\nStucker with United Vice President Praveen Sharma celebrating 18 million flown miles.\nHow does one end up flying\u00a018 million miles? Stuker is an auto-industry sales and management consultant based in New Jersey, and his work takes him to many individual car dealerships around the world. He\u2019s flown to Hawaii over 100 times and to Australia over 300 times. \u201cI\u2019ve probably seen more of Australia than 95% of Australians,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nAfter flying so many miles on United, Stuker is likely the world\u2019s utmost\u00a0authority\u00a0when it comes to the airline\u2019s planes and seats. \u201cThe three-class 767 is without a doubt my\u00a0favorite aircraft,\u201d he said, while\u00a0acknowledging it will soon be phased out in favor of two-cabin Polaris business. His preferred seat on the 767 is 1K, because \u201ctypically on an international flight, the pilot [off-duty rest seat] is in 2K with the drapes around him, so 1K feels like a private plane,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou\u2019ve got five people in first class so the stewardess gives you plenty of attention.\u201d\n\nWhat about the food? His favorite three dishes on United \u2014 in no particular order \u2014 are the lobster mac and cheese (\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable, I love it!\u201d), the cinnamon rolls they serve outside the US and the garlic bread.\u00a0\u201cOne food I\u2019m not liking is the salad,\u201d Stuker confided. \u201cThey\u2019re getting too fancy with the salad. Apples and grapes and pears. They\u2019ve got everything in it but lettuce and tomatoes. I\u2019m actually thinking of bringing my own.\u201d\n\nBut eating on board depends on the timing of his\u00a0flight. \u201cGoing to Australia, you\u2019re taking off and its 1:30am New York\u00a0time and I think I\u2019ve had enough meals by 1:30 in the morning,\u201d he said.\n\nStuker and his wife, Darlene. She travels\u00a0with him multiple times a year.\nWhen Stuker isn\u2019t traveling for work, he likes using his stash of United MileagePlus miles to take leisure\u00a0trips with others.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m able to use my miles to take my friends and family to places around the world. I\u2019ve taken my son around the world twice,\u201d he said. And those trips aren\u2019t lacking in amenities. \u201cWhat most people consider a honeymoon trip, I take six times a year with my\u00a0wife.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of frequent flyer miles, just how many does he have? Stuker would prefer not to disclose an exact number, but he doesn\u2019t use them solely for flights.\n\n\u201cObviously the best value in using your miles is for flying, but sometimes I\u2019ll\u00a0redeem for gift cards because there\u2019s only so much flying I have\u00a0time for outside of work. I use miles for cruises, hotels, rental cars, auctions \u2014 United has great auctions.\u201d\n\nStuker is also involved in a cancer charity called Bailey\u2019s Day in Albert, Australia, and donates his miles for the charity\u2019s auctions.\n\nAs a road warrior \u2014 perhaps the road warrior \u2014 Stuker doesn\u2019t focus on one single hotel chain as he does with his airline. But he still has plenty of annual hotel nights\u00a0to earn elite status in multiple\u00a0hotel loyalty programs.\n\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m a lifetime Diamond at Hilton, a lifetime Platinum at Marriott and almost a lifetime Globalist at Hyatt,\u201d he said good-naturedly. \u201cThough I think my streak of being Globalist\u00a0at Hyatt is going to end this year because they raised it to 60 nights. But when I travel with my wife, I try to raise the bar a little more and stay at a Ritz-Carlton. I love the in-and-out properties where you have a swimming pool villa. When people ask what I like to do on vacation, I say \u2018as little as possible.'\u201d\n\nStuker\u2019s accomplishments have become legendary over the years. He\u2019s been covered in the\u00a0The New York Times,\u00a0along with\u00a0ABC News,\u00a0NBC\u00a0News and many others. An entire\u00a0Flyertalk thread is dedicated just to him\u00a0and is now approaching its eighth year of posts.\n\nStuker prepares to hit the road again, on United as always.\nBut when we asked Stuker if he has\u00a0any tips on\u00a0flying, his thoughts centered around being aware and respectful of others. \u201cTry to be more conscious of your surroundings,\u201d he suggested. \u201cIf you\u2019re\u00a0on the phone before you depart, the last three rows of the plane don\u2019t have to hear it. If there\u2019s someone older with a bag, why don\u2019t you get up and help them put it up?\u201d\n\nThe same advice goes for dealing with the airline\u2019s employees: \u201cI\u2019ve always found if you really treat people nice, then the service is out of this world. Like all of us, they like to be appreciated in their job.\u201d\n\nWhat about all of United\u2019s recent bad publicity? \u201cWhen people say \u2018I had a bad experience on United,\u2019 well, I had 9,000 great experiences,\u201d\u00a0Stuker said. \u201c999 out of 1,000 people who I talk to at Global Services, I rate them a 10 out of 10. These people are like a second family to me. I really appreciate how hard they work.\u201d\n\nWith 18 million miles officially in the rearview mirror, Stuker shows no signs of slowing down \u2014 even after more than 45 years of flying.\n\n\u201cThe latest I should make 20 million miles is 2020. In all likelihood though, probably sometime in late 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cI really enjoy flying. I really do.\u201d\n\nPhotos courtesy of United Airlines.\n",
