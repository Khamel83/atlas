      "Selection": "President Trump\u2019s recent decision to temporarily ban people from seven Muslim-majority countries, along with all refugees, is billed as religion neutral. It\u2019s not a Muslim ban, the argument goes, because it blocks people of all religions \u2014 as long as they\u2019re a refugee or from one of the seven countries.\n\nBut it\u2019s not so simple.\n\nIf you take a close look at Trump\u2019s executive order, you see that it contains a major loophole \u2014 an exemption from its ban on refugee entry to the United States for \u201creligious minorities\u201d being persecuted by their governments. Who\u2019s going to qualify for these exemptions? A lot of Christians \u2014 according to Trump himself. Here\u2019s what he said in a Friday interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network\u2019s David Brody:\n\nBRODY: Persecuted Christians, we\u2019ve talked about this, the refugees overseas. The refugee program, or the refugee changes you\u2019re looking to make. As it relates to persecuted Christians, do you see them as kind of a priority here?\n\nTRUMP: Yes.\n\nBRODY: You do?\n\nTRUMP: They\u2019ve been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.\n\nTrump\u2019s executive order may not officially set up a religious test for admission. But the president\u2019s comments make clear that this is, in fact, the intent. It\u2019s not an accident that Trump singled out seven Muslim-majority countries for his blanket bans on immigration.\n\nThere is no good justification for this policy. Trump\u2019s stated one, fighting terrorism, collapses under the slightest scrutiny. No, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s only one real reason for enacting policies that disproportionately block Muslims from entering the United States \u2014 bigotry.\n\nThis is Islamophobia\n\nThe text of Trump\u2019s executive order never uses the words \u201cIslam\u201d or \u201cMuslim.\u201d Perhaps that\u2019s for legal reasons. But it\u2019s so full of code words that it\u2019s impossible to mistake the intent.\n\n\u201cIn order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles,\u201d the order says. \u201cThe United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law.\u201d\n\nWhich \u201cviolent ideologies\u201d are those? Surely it\u2019s not white nationalism \u2014 the executive order doesn\u2019t ban Scandinavian skinheads from entering the United States. Instead, it bars anyone and everyone from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, Somalia, Sudan, and Libya, making clear that the theory behind this order is that Muslims, specifically foreign-born Muslims, are seen as an especial kind of threat of violent extremism.\n\nThis is a dubious theory. Since 9/11, home-grown white supremacists and similar extremists have killed more Americans in the US than all Islamic extremists, American or non-American, put together. It seems that, if your goal is saving lives and stopping extremism, it makes more sense to look at home than singling out a group of immigrants who come, disproportionately, from one religious group.\n\nBut let\u2019s game it out, on Trump\u2019s terms. Is banning a large swath of Muslim immigrants a good way to reduce the terrorist threat?\n\nAgain, the answer is no. No perpetrator of a major terrorist attack in the United States has hailed from a country on Trump\u2019s list. And even if you include the death toll from 9/11, the overall threat level from immigrants is really low. A recent study from the Cato Institute\u2019s Alex Nowrasteh found that an American\u2019s odds of being killed by an immigrant terrorist of any faith are one in 3.6 million. The odds of being killed by a refugee specifically are even higher: One in 3.6 billion.\n\nYou\u2019re more likely to be killed by your own clothes than an immigrant terrorist.\n\nAnd if the justification were actually security, then Trump\u2019s \u201creligious persecution\u201d exemption wouldn\u2019t make a lick of sense. There is no way for the US government to tell if, say, a Syrian refugee is actually a Christian \u2014 it\u2019s not the kind of thing you can prove easily. The Syrian ISIS operatives that Trump is so concerned about could simply say there were Christian \u2014 and who\u2019s to say they\u2019re wrong?\n\nThe only justification for this provision, instead, is political.\n\n\u201cEvangelical Christians have long been concerned about the persecution of Christians in the Middle East; they\u2019re also the group in the Republican coalition that puts the highest value on welcoming refugees,\u201d my colleague Dara Lind explains. \u201cThe \u2018religious-minority\u2019 loophole gives an ally of the Trump administration \u2014 one that might have objected vociferously to this move \u2014 something it wants.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all well and good. But it lays bare the actual logic behind the Trump order, which is bigotry. Trump thinks that Muslims pose a threat to the United States, because they are more likely to join a terrorist group. He\u2019s said as much in the past, calling religious profiling of Muslims by police \u201ccommon sense.\u201d That means that, from Trump\u2019s point of view, having fewer Muslims in the country makes sense.\n\nFrom this point of view, the executive order makes sense. It will, in fact, limit the number of Muslims in the United States \u2014 tens of thousands of Muslims come in every year as refugees. Many people come from the seven Muslim-majority countries that Trump targets as students or tourists.\n\nSo while the executive order makes very little sense as a counterterrorism policy, no matter how you slice it, it makes perfect sense as a kind of Muslim Exclusion Act. Sure, it doesn\u2019t end Muslim immigration \u2014 most Muslim-majority countries aren\u2019t targeted. But the policy is transparently targeted at reducing Muslim immigration specifically. It\u2019s bigoted because it disproportionately affects Muslims, not because it affects every Muslim.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly how advocacy and human rights groups see it.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has cloaked what is a discriminatory ban against nationals of Muslim countries under the banner of national security,\" Greg Chen, director of advocacy at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told Reuters.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone. Donald Trump is the same man who once called for a \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d He never retracted this policy idea or apologized for it. He simply modified it to be more politically palatable and legally workable.\n\nThe current executive order is the result of that process. It\u2019s a kind of Muslim-ban lite, dressed up in non-religious language to avoid legal challenges and political blowback. Trump and his team is counting on the public to be tricked, to limit the backlash against turning Islamophobia into the official guiding light of American immigration policy.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled.",
