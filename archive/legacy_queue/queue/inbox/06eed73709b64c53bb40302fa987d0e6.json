It\u2019s based on an old-ish study from 1978 by Taylor LJ that evaluated handwashing techniques by health professionals. I\u2019m guessing (hoping) that technique has improved since then.\n\nAlso, if there were a diagram based on data collected from the men\u2019s room, the hands would just be completely colored red. Wash your hands, please. It\u2019s kind of important right now.\n\nTags: handwash, hygiene\n",
