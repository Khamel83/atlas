      "Selection": "Via Points With a Crew, Virgin America is having a sale to lots of destinations, including Hawaii!\u00a0 And because it has merged with Alaska Airlines, you can also find these low fares through the Alaska Airlines website!\u00a0 These deals expire October 2, 2017.\n\nI found flights from San Jose, California, to Honolulu for\u00a0$189 one-way\u00a0in coach. \u00a0And from San Francisco to Maui for\u00a0$199 one-way\u00a0in coach.\n\nBuy Flights to Hawaii at a Discount Through October 3, 2017\n1. \u00a0 Alaska Airlines\n\nLink: \u00a0\u00a0Alaska Airlines Sale\n\nThrough October 2, 2017, you can buy select\u00a0Alaska Airlines\u00a0flights for as low as $42 one-way, though most fares are higher.\u00a0 For example, I found a flight from Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale for\u00a0$97 one-way\u00a0in coach on\u00a0October 17, 2017.\n\nHere are the details:\n\nSale ends at\u00a011:59 pm Pacific Time on October 2, 2017\n\nYou must book travel\u00a0at least 21 days in advance\n\nValid for travel Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, between\u00a0October 17\u00a0and\u00a0November 8, 2017\n\nSale applies to non-stop flights only\n\nTickets are\u00a0non-refundable\u00a0and are only available on flights marketed by Alaska Airlines for travel on Alaska Airlines, Virgin America, Horizon Air, SkyWest, and PenAir\n\n2. \u00a0 Virgin America\n\nLink: \u00a0\u00a0Virgin America Sale\n\nVirgin America\u00a0is running practically the same exact sale with the same end date of October 2, 2017.\u00a0 As an example, I found a flight from San Francisco to Denver for\u00a0$69 one-way\u00a0on\u00a0October 17, 2017.\n\nHere are the details of this sale:\n\nSale ends at\u00a09:59 pm Pacific Time on October 2, 2017\n\nYou must book travel\u00a0at least 21 days in advance\n\nValid for travel Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, between\u00a0October 17\u00a0and\u00a0November 8, 2017\n\nThese sales are mostly similar, with a few key differences:\n\nThe Virgin America sale ends 2 hours before the Alaska Airlines sale\n\nVirgin America award prices are tied to the cash price of the seat.\u00a0 So when there is a sale, it costs fewer points to book the flights.\n\nBoth sales have blackout dates, so check their landing pages to see if your travel dates are available!\n\nHotel Information\n\nIf you book a sale flight, remember there are lots of ways to get cheap or free hotel rooms with points from credit card bonuses and spending.\n\nTo find hotels that can be booked with points, I use Hotel Hustle (which even shows you if rooms are actually available!) or AwardMapper.\n\nRemember, you can transfer flexible points like Chase Ultimate Rewards or American Express Membership Rewards to different hotel programs. \u00a0\n\nNote:\u00a0 If you prefer to book paid stays, check out discount sites like Orbitz, Expedia, or TravelPony for deals.\u00a0 But remember you won\u2019t get stay credits or points (and might not have your elite status recognized!).\n\nAirbnb is another terrific way to save money on accommodations, especially for longer stays.\u00a0 Here are\u00a0some tips on how to negotiate a better Airbnb price, and how to find a safe and comfortable Airbnb.\n\nUse a Credit Card That Earns Bonus Miles & Points\n\nThese cards earn bonus miles or points for paid airfare:\n\nCard Name\n\nWhat It Earns\n\nThe Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN\n\n- Earn 3X American Express Membership Rewards points on airfare purchased directly from airlines when you choose this as your 3X category (otherwise earn 2X points)\n- Here's my review of the card\n- Terms apply\n\nPremier Rewards Gold Card from American Express\n\n- Earn 3X American Express Membership Rewards points for airfare purchased directly from airlines\n- $100 Airline fee credit.
