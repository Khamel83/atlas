      "Selection": "Image: Niantic Labs\n\nPok\u00e9mon Go creator Niantic Labs is partnering with Punchdrunk, the New York City-based production company behind seminal immersive theater piece Sleep No More. The partnership will see both companies work toward \u201cdeveloping multiple projects that will reinvent storytelling for a 21st century audience and further expand the horizon of interactive entertainment.\u201d\n\nSleep No More, launched in 2011, is an immersive theater production that lets audiences walk through a series of rooms and experience various storylines and other elements of the production at their own pace. Influenced in part by haunted houses and other nonlinear live productions, immersive theater sounds like a prime fit for augmented reality because it could allow for Niantic and companies like Punchdrunk to create fantastical virtual worlds that are then overlaid over real spaces.\n\nImmersive theater seems like a prime fit for augmented reality\n\n\u201cIt is hugely exciting to be joining forces with the preeminent AR company in the world. At Punchdrunk we create richly cinematic 3D worlds where audiences can explore, touch and smell the environment; where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are indistinguishable,\u201d Felix Barrett, Punchdrunk\u2019s artistic director, said in a statement. \u201cThose that have seen Sleep No More often liken the experience to how it might feel to walk into a video game. What happens if you take that sense of adventure into the real world? Tear down the walls and the world becomes your stage. \u201c\n\nNiantic offered a few more updates to its current production pipeline, too. The company is still currently working on the mobile AR adaptation of popular board game Catan called Catan: World Explorers. The game is being built on top of Niantic\u2019s Real World Platform in partnership with the company behind the board game and French game publisher Asmodee. Niantic now says the game will enter a beta phase \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\nNiantic also says it\u2019s building \u201cnew forms of gaming\u201d for both smartphones and AR glasses, although the company did not elaborate on exactly what headsets from which companies it may be building for. \u201cCurrently, we have more than 10 new games in development including prototypes for AR wearables, each with unique and innovative gameplay, centered around outdoor exploration, movement and social interaction,\u201d the company says.\n\nIn December 2019, Qualcomm announced it was working with Niantic on a smart glasses reference design as part of the chipmaker\u2019s Snapdragon XR2 platform. And back in 2017, when support for Apple\u2019s ARKit was first added to Pok\u00e9mon Go, Niantic strongly hinted it was working with Apple on experiences that could arrive for the iPhone maker\u2019s not-yet-announced but strongly rumored AR glasses.\n",
