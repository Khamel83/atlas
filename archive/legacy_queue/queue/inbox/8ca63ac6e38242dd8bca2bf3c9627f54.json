      "Title": "Take it from Khrushchev\u2019s granddaughter Melania Trump is the perfect autocrat\u2019s wife Quartz",
      "Selection": "There are many institutions of democracy that US president Donald Trump has attempted to undermine during his short time in office, including the judiciary and the independent press. He is governing by Twitter and by decree, like the budding autocrat he is.\n\nAs a former Soviet, I recognize these symbols of creeping authoritarianism. A first post-Soviet \u201ctsar\u201d of Russian democracy, Boris Yeltsin also chaotically ruled by decree, arguing that communists would undermine him and painting himself as the lone hero of the new Russia. Trump, who is eager to go it alone in his quest for the parochial and reactionary \u201cAmerica First,\u201d fights not communism, but liberal democracy, with its foundations of shared responsibility.\n\nIndeed, Trump\u2019s insistence on making \u201cultimate decisions\u201d all by himself unite him with autocratic leaders who value personal rulings over general laws. In fact, his wife Melania Trump\u2019s striking invisibility at White House events further underscores similarities between the 20th-century Soviet Union and America of 2017. Last month, during Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s visit to the United States, Mrs. Abe had to tour the US Capitol alone, while Melania\u2019s absence marked a dramatic break in the established political protocol. And in the first three weeks after the inauguration, even Melania\u2019s official Twitter account, the preferred information medium of this whole presidency, posted just one tweet announcing her as the First Lady.\n\nOn Sunday, \u201chosting\u201d the annual Governors Ball, she appeared robotic, barely present at the event that she had allegedly planned. In a statement (not a personalized welcome) she declared that the ball was about unity and not politics, a plan that got quickly derailed by her husband\u2019s promise to undo the Affordable Care Act. Remember, at his press-conference a few weeks ago, Trump told us that one of her causes is to advocate for women. Yet at the ball he only welcomed \u201cGovernors, their wives and daughters.\u201d He does know that women can be, and are governors, in the United States, right? Mrs. Trump isn\u2019t responsible for the president\u2019s words, but she clearly wasn\u2019t consulted, either.\n\nAttending Trump\u2019s address to Congress Tuesday, Melania served a similarly decorative purpose. Dressed in a $9,600 sparkling black outfit, she almost sleepwalked to her seat and remained still as a statue.\n\nIn an autocracy, institutions such as the FLOTUS position\u2014not fully formal, yet relevant\u2014are the easiest to undermine. In Russia\u2014first a monarchy and then a communist dictatorship\u2014where \u201cunsharable\u201d power of the leader has been personalized and centralized to an extreme, there was barely ever a true \u201cfirst lady,\u201d her very fate providing a symbolic commentary on the regime.\n\nJoseph Stalin\u2019s Gulags\u2014mass incarceration and prosecution of everyone suspected of opposing his personal power\u2014were foreshadowed by the death of his wife, Nadezhda. Lacking a role to perform in the Kremlin\u2019s politics, she committed suicide in 1932. According to a 1988 report in the New York Times, a Stalin biographer wrote that she killed herself \u201d after she spoke her mind about Comunist Party purges and the famine and was met by a flood of vulgar abuse from Stalin.\u201d\n\nDuring the less repressive periods, such as Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s post-Stalinism era or Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s perestroika, the first wives could enter the public stage. Khrushchev\u2019s wife Nina, in her flowery dress that almost by design looked like a home gown, embraced a role of a \u201cnational mother.\u201d She traveled with her husband abroad, delivering his message of \u201ccommunism with a human face.\u201d Three decades later, given her husband\u2019s liberalizing reforms, Raisa Gorbachev finally seized a chance to transform the Russian first wife\u2019s position into a real democratic institution of the first lady, publicly caring for causes such as education. Appearing an equal partner to the first Soviet president, she made Gorbachev\u2019s reforms visible to the outside world.\n\nThe fragile institution, however, couldn\u2019t survive Russia\u2019s centralized system for long. With the collapse of communism, when Russia fancied itself a democracy in the early 1990s for Yeltsin and the early 2000s for Vladimir Putin, both presidents briefly attempted to support the first lady\u2019s role. Their wives attended international meetings and accompanied their husbands to summits with world leaders. Putin\u2019s (now former) wife Lyudmila even picked a cause\u2014prison reform for incarcerated women. But her first lady star dimmed quickly. She herself explained that Putin, as a traditional man, expected his wife to stay home. Her fashion choices also didn\u2019t lend credibility to the position\u2014one time meeting with Great Britain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth she sported a dramatically larger hat than that of the Queen. The ever image-conscious Putin decided that he was better off as a lonely crusader. Unceremoniously divorcing Lyudmila in 2013, he thus finalized his Kremlin-style bromance with Dmitry Medvedev, Russia\u2019s puppet president from 2008 to 2012.\n\nIndeed, its flirtations with democracy notwithstanding, Russia is so patriarchal that even its de facto first lady is a man. Medvedev\u2019s four years aimed to bring some civilizing influence to Putin\u2019s tough-guy persona: he was to give the appearance of fostering modernization and encouraging economic reform, just as first ladies dole out cookies and make sure that cutlery is a match.\n\nEmulating the Putin-Medvedev dynamic, Trump\u2014constantly concerned with appearing an ultimate macho-man\u2014seemingly embraces and admires vice president Mike Pence more than he does his wife. Pence serves a clearer purpose for Trump, packaging the president\u2019s megalomania into the palpable language of the Republican politics.\n\nSurely, American first ladies have not always had to be the wife of the president. The role of the White House hostess has been performed, well, not by another man, but by their daughters or cousins, as was the case of the 19th-century bachelor James Buchanan. In the modern incarnation of American democracy, however, the job requires a spousal touch. In recent decades, the East Wing has played an increasingly political role in support of POTUS.\n\nIn this White House, however, Trump\u2019s eldest daughter Ivanka has been more prominently featured than Melania. Appearing with his wife in public, just like the patriarchal types of the old, Trumps shows little affection\u2014rare holding hands or making other small gestures. The Trumps\u2019 seemingly cool relationship presents no \u201csense of the person behind Melania\u2019s Slavic mask.\u201d Some say that this exported fashion model from Eastern Europe is \u201cscared\u201d; others suggest \u201cshe doesn\u2019t want to be there\u201d at all. All of this is projection. What is clear is that Melania\u2019s role in the White House is to follow her master\u2019s plan\u2014to serve as a kept woman with a perfect posture, a poster image, a magazine cover, a billboard display.\n\nAs the objectified first lady, Melania is not designed to speak and function in public life. Even her fashion\u2014monochrome outfits in jewel tones\u2014betrays that overdressed Barbie nature. Hot pink or baby blue are sure signs of ambition, and yet ambiguity. Her now famous Tootsie-style pussy bow fuchsia outfit worn at a presidential debate last fall could have been a strong feminist and ironic rebuke of Donald\u2019s \u201cpussy grabbing\u201d advances to women. Yet her fashion choice has only confirmed her traditionalism, her affinity with frilly fashions of the 1980s, when she was coming of age in a provincial communist town of Sevnica, Slovenia.\n\nEven Melania\u2019s first lady \u201ccause\u201d\u2014cyberbullying\u2014is oxymoronic. How could she confront that problem when her husband is the US cyberbully-in-chief? Such Orwellian twists\u2014war is peace and so on\u2014are all in keeping with this aspiring autocracy.\n\nFrench philosopher Charles Fourier once noted that social progress is evaluated by the way it treats women. As such, the way that first ladies conduct themselves reflects more than just their personalities and values. As with Russian first wives, they symbolize the nature of the presidency.\n\nThe spectacularly fit Michelle Obama\u2019s highly visible focus on health encouraged Americans to exercise and eat well; it prompted her husband to stop smoking and set an example for the nation. Hillary Clinton, filled with her own political ambition, brought discipline and force to her husband\u2019s meandering and seductive style of leadership. To mark the new era of civil rights, Rosalynn Carter pointedly sat in on her husband\u2019s Cabinet meetings. Jacqueline Kennedy, a fashion icon married to the most charming man on earth, famously redecorated the White House.\n\nAnd so Melania\u2019s strikingly nonexistent White House life marks a dramatic departure from the institutional rules of American democracy\u2014one of many such departures that have increasingly become the unfortunate hallmarks of this new administration. The position of the first lady, as Rebecca Mead notes in the New Yorker, is \u201cinherently retrogressive.\u201d But other presidential wives have tried to make the best of the role. Melania does not have such agency, precisely because this is a White House that does not value women at all.\n\nFollow Nina on Twitter. Learn how to write for Quartz Ideas.
