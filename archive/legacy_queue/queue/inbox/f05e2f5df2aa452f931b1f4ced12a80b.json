      "Title": "Amazon is everywhere, and companies can\u2019t stop talking about it Quartz",
      "Selection": "The modern company can work with Amazon, or work against it.\n\nIgnoring Amazon.com Inc. is no longer a viable option. The company\u2014if company is even an adequate word to describe it\u2014touches e-commerce, logistics, manufacturing, grocery, customer service, cloud services, hardware, robotics, artificial intelligence, the auto industry, the finance industry, real estate, health care, and fashion, among other things. The corners of the economy that Amazon has yet to reach\u00a0get fewer and farther between every day.\n\nAmazon\u2019s breadth and influence is evident not only in its recently acquired position as\u00a0world\u2019s most valuable company, or the unprecedented personal fortune of founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos (assuming his pending divorce leaves enough of it intact). It\u2019s also apparent in just how frequently other companies wind up discussing, well, Amazon.\n\nIn 2018, executives of public companies worldwide mentioned \u201cAmazon\u201d in more than 2,300 calls and conference presentations, according to a Quartz analysis of transcript data from research firm Sentieo. That was slightly less than the 2,402 conversations that \u201cAmazon\u201d cropped up in during 2017, and far more than the nearly 1,600 transcripts the company\u2019s name graced in 2016. Those counts exclude mentions of \u201cAmazon\u201d by Amazon itself.\n\n\u201cAmazon\u201d comes up in different contexts. Sometimes it\u2019s a company praising Amazon as a business partner. (Salesforce co-CEO Keith Block this past November: \u201cAmazon is a great company, they\u2019re a super partner of ours.\u201d) Other times it\u2019s a boast of stacking up favorably against one of Amazon\u2019s offerings. (Oracle\u2019s Larry Ellison in October: \u201cOur cloud is as easy to use as Amazon, and we have ambitions to be better.\u201d)\n\nWhether Amazon is bad for competition is a matter for lawyers and regulators to decide. But the sheer volume of \u201cAmazon\u201d mentions by companies across industries and around the globe leaves little doubt of how powerful and pervasive Amazon is. Every company on some level fears an onslaught from the so-called Everything Store. Amazon\u2019s ruthless efficiency, willingness to scrape by on thin margins, and unmitigated ambition make it the ultimate competitor.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a company in the world that shouldn\u2019t be worried about Amazon on some level,\u201d Robert Perdue, chief operating officer of digital ad firm The Trade DeskPerdue, said at a technology conference in September. \u201cYou can put up almost every industry sector, and some part of that sector\u00a0Amazon\u00a0is competing\u00a0with at this point.\u201d\n\nA bitter pill\n\nOne of the most notable industries to experience a spike in Amazon chatter over the last 18 months was health care.\n\nAmazon popped up on the health-care sector\u2019s radar in 2017 for its\u00a0rumored interest in pharmacy and drug distribution.\u00a0Health-care executives were forced to address the Amazon factor so often that mentions of \u201cAmazon\u201d eclipsed mentions of \u201cemergency room\u201d in both the third and fourth quarters of that year.\u00a0\u201dAmazon\u00a0could be both a competitor in some areas and a collaborator in others,\u201d Susan\u00a0DeVore, president and CEO of health-care services provider Premier, said on an earnings call in November 2017. That December,\u00a0CVS Health said it would merge with health insurer Aetna, a decision widely interpreted as a hedge against Amazon.\n\nAmazon\u2019s rumored interest in pharmacy was substantiated in June 2018 when it bought PillPack, a prescription-management startup, for a reported $1 billion. The acquisition instantly shaved $23.5 billion off the market capitalization of the biggest 10 health-care companies.\n\nAnother shock to health care arrived earlier that year, in January, when Amazon, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase announced a joint plan to tackle health care. The companies said they would create a new venture, \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints,\u201d to reduce health care costs and improve satisfaction for their US employees. The market values of\u00a0health insurance and pharmacy stocks\u00a0dropped by billions of dollars. And in the first quarter of 2018, health-care companies mentioned Amazon on 54 separate calls and conferences, an all-time high.\n\nFrom online to offline\n\nAmazon buying Whole Foods was a game-changer in grocery but also in real estate.\n\nThe $13.7 billion purchase was a clear sign that Amazon, a company known for its prowess online, intended to develop a physical presence. If Amazon was doing it, other e-commerce companies were sure to follow. All of that was good news for property managers and developers, and in late 2017, real-estate executives mentioned \u201cAmazon\u201d almost as often as \u201clandlord.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs demonstrated by\u00a0Amazon\u2019s\u00a0acquisition\u00a0of\u00a0Whole\u00a0Foods \u2026 online retailers demonstrated a need for physical space for a variety of reasons,\u201d\u00a0SmartREIT CEO Huw Thomas said in November 2017.\n\nAs of Dec. 31, 2017, Amazon leased 240 million square feet of space for offices, physical stores, fulfillment and data centers, and unspecified other uses. That included leases for 465 Whole Foods stores in North America and seven internationally that Amazon gained with its June purchase of Whole Foods. As of Dec. 31, Amazon also owned 14 million square feet, most of which was used for Amazon Web Services or its international operations.\n\nThat number almost certainly rose in 2018, with Amazon\u2019s lease of the 400,000-square-foot Expedia tower\u00a0in Seattle, the expansion of its\u00a0Amazon Go automated convenience stores, and its planned lease of 1 million square feet of office space in Long Island City.\n\n\u201cWe really see brick-and-mortar retail becoming relevant again,\u201d Michael Landy, CEO of Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation, said on an earnings call in November 2018. \u201cYou see Amazon owning Whole Foods, Amazon Go. They\u2019re investing at brick-and-mortar retail.\u201d A month earlier, David Jamieson or Kimco Realty Corporation said the Amazon Go expansion demonstrated \u201chigh, high demand for great quality real estate on the small shop category.\u201d\n\nThe customer-obsession pays off\n\nConsumer discretionary companies, which sell goods and services considered \u201cnon-essential\u201d to consumers, are obvious competitors of Amazon.com. The sector includes Ebay, Gap, Hasbro, Macy\u2019s, Nike, Starbucks, and Amazon itself. Amazon is the behemoth that can\u2019t be ignored.\n\nSince 2016, mentions of \u201cAmazon\u201d by executives from this sector on calls and at conferences have soared. Many of these references come from companies describing how they have integrated their products and services into Amazon\u2019s platform. \u201cOur brand and select products are now accessible through our Harley-Davidson branded Amazon storefront,\u201d Matthew Levatich, CEO of the motorcycle maker, said on an October 2018 call. \u201cAmazon offers unrivaled access to hundreds of millions of potential new customers.\u201d\n\nSuch partnerships can be seen as a deal with the devil. Nike, for example, partnered with Amazon in June 2017 to sell products directly through its website after years of resistance. The deal gave Nike access to Amazon\u2019s estimated 80 million US Prime members. Nike also got Amazon to commit to closer monitoring of third-party merchants selling Nike wares without permission, or even sometimes Nike counterfeits. But selling on Amazon also risked diluting Nike\u2019s premium brand, especially if Amazon pressured it into uncharacteristic price cuts.\n\nThe rise in consumer discretionary firms talking about Amazon is particularly stark\u00a0compared to mentions of \u201cWalmart\u201d (or \u201cWal-Mart\u201d), which if anything has been discussed less in recent years.\n\n\u201cAmazon faces intense competition every day in every business we operate, from retail to entertainment to consumer electronics to technology,\u201d an Amazon spokesman said in an emailed statement. \u201cRetail is our largest business and it\u2019s still less than 1% of global retail.\u201d\n\nOne new reason consumer companies are eyeing Amazon is the company\u2019s push into private- and exclusive-label brands. These labels are either owned by Amazon or made by another company or manufacturer and sold exclusively on Amazon\u2019s site. These brands compete directly with name brands and house labels sold by traditional retailers, like Target\u2019s Up&Up or Walmart\u2019s Great Value. For the manufacturer, fashioning an exclusive brand for Amazon can be an alternative to being subsumed outright.\n\n\u201cAmazon for a number of years had asked us to consider selling them the Carter\u2019s brand,\u201d Richard Westenberger, CEO of $3.7 billion baby and children\u2019s clothing company Carter\u2019s, said at a retail conference this past September. \u201cFor a number of reasons, we didn\u2019t know if that made sense. So we shared that experience with Amazon and last year we launched a brand called \u2018Simple Joys,\u2019 made exclusively for Amazon Prime customers by Carter\u2019s.\u201d Simple Joys, Westenberger continued, was \u201cby far the most successful\u201d of the four brands Carter\u2019s sold with Amazon. \u201cAmazon uses it as their private label brand and because of that, they put more energy behind it, more marketing dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very, very good relationship.\u201d\n",
