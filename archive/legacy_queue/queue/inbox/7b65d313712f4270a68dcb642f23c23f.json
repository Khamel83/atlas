      "Selection": "This past Tuesday, paint company Behr announced its first-ever Color of the Year. It\u2019s a shade that the company has christened \u201cIn The Moment T18-15,\u201d a mellow blue-green tinctured with gray.\n\nPhoto\u00a0by Behr\n\nThe company believes this particular color encourages mindfulness, that it's a tonic to the overstimulation of the digital age. It's a color meant to nudge us away from our devices and closer to nature.\n\n\u201cIn The Moment speaks to our society\u2019s desire to disconnect and be present,\u201d Erika Woelfel, Behr\u2019s vice president of color and creative services, said in a statement. It\u2019s certainly a nice shade. The color's quite chameleonic, too, adapting to its surroundings so that it accents darker rooms, vivid and luminous when surrounded by light.\n\nPhoto\u00a0by Behr\n\nPhoto\u00a0by Behr\n\nPhoto\u00a0by Behr\n\nPhoto\u00a0by Behr \n\nPhoto\u00a0by Behr\n\nPhoto\u00a0by Behr\n\nPhoto\u00a0by Behr\n\nPhoto\u00a0by Behr\n\nIf In The Moment isn\u2019t quite your speed, Behr has also rolled out a \u201cColor Trends palette\u201d that\u2019s a spectrum of 20 shades they believe we'll be seeing more of over the next year.\n\nInterpret this campaign as a bid, on Behr\u2019s part, as a way to join the same bandwagon as Pantone, who annually dubs a certain color the Color of the Year. To my mind, In The Moment certainly beats any shade Pantone has picked in recent memory, though it doesn\u2019t have a patch on Marrs Green, that blazing hue chosen as the world\u2019s favorite color just a few weeks back.\n\nDo You Like Pantone's 2017 Color of the Year? \nby\u00a0Amanda Sims\nThis Is the World's Favorite Color\u2014and We're Into It\nby\u00a0Mayukh Sen\n\nBut I understand why people may find Marrs Green too disorienting a color to bring into their homes. In The Moment is something like the more muted spiritual sister to Marrs Green. I'll take it.\n\nLearn more about Behr's Color Trends 2018 campaign here. What's your take on In The Moment?
