      "Selection": "A writer goes undercover at a shipping warehouse in Mississippi\u2014and wonders whether Americans will ever demand higher standards for how their Internet purchases are being fulfilled:<br /><br />\n\n\"We will be fired if we say we just can't or won't get better, the workamper tells me. But so long as I resign myself to hearing how inadequate I am on a regular basis, I can keep this job. 'Do you think this job has to be this terrible?' I ask the workamper.<br /><br />\n\n\"'Oh, no,' she says, and makes a face at me like I've asked a stupid question, which I have.
