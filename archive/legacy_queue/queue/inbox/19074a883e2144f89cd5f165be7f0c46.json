      "Selection": "A chef's right hand may be their knife, but the left hand\u2014at least in my kitchen\u2014is the castiron skillet, which earns its keep at least twice over. Some love their cast iron pans so much they go on and write odes to it in the form of \u200bcookbooks\u200b, like Charlotte Druckman did. Use it on the grill, or in the oven, or over a roaring fire at your campsite, or on top of a wood-burning oven, or on your stovetop for everything from a brunchy pan of shakshuka to a birthday cake.\n\nThe pan itself is mythic and revered, often with a story about where it came from (my dad pulled mine off the side of the road and seasoned it for me) and it's happy as a clam as long as you care for it (a process oft-debated).\n\nIt also carries a dose of cabin-in-the-woods romanticism to it\u2014so there's no better time to sing its praises than during Summer Camp Week.\n\nHere are just a few of the recipes that inspire us to pull out our skillets:\n\nSauteed Corn, Green Onions, and Shiitake Mushrooms\nby\u00a0healthierkitchen\nChimichurri Shrimp\nby\u00a0Alexandra Stafford\nMoroccan Chicken Hash with Harissa Cream\nby\u00a0hardlikearmour\nRaspberry-Rhubarb Crumble with Cracklin' Oat Bran Topping\nby\u00a0Sarah Jampel\nSkillet-Grilled Fish Tacos with Cilantro-Lime Crema \nby\u00a0Alexandra Stafford\nJosh Ozersky's 3-Minute Hash Browns\nby\u00a0Genius Recipes\nBrown Butter Nutella Skillet Cookie\nby\u00a0Phyllis Grant\nSpring Vegetable Jumble with Lemon-Tarragon Butter\nby\u00a0fiveandspice\n\nFresh Fig Cornbread\nby\u00a0fiveandspice\nAvocado Cornbread\nby\u00a0aargersi\n\nSkillet Strata with Bacon, Cheddar, and Greens\nby\u00a0Alexandra Stafford\nDyers Island Lobster Hash\nby\u00a0Stephen Gray\nSocca (Farinata)\nby\u00a0Gena Hamshaw\nCreamed Leek and Egg Skillet Pizza\nby\u00a0fiveandspice\nNew England Spider Cake\nby\u00a0Sarah Jampel\n\nIs there one recipe you always make in your cast-iron pan?
