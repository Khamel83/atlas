      "Selection": "Dutch artist Berndnaut Smilde creates ephemeral water vapor sculptures (you know, clouds!) in places you normally wouldn\u2019t find them, like inside churches & museums. He shared some of his process with National Geographic:\n\nThe ingredients for Smilde\u2019s clouds: just smoke and water vapor. He requires a cold and damp space with no air circulation, lest the clouds never form or fall straight to the ground. He mists an area with a spray bottle to put water vapor into the air. Then he turns on fog machines that spout tiny particles, and the vapor condenses around them.\n\nSmilde runs around the forming cloud, coaxing it into a shape about 10 feet across and six feet tall. Then he steps back long enough for a photographer to snap several images. Once the air clears, he\u2019ll start over, repeating the process dozens of times until he\u2019s happy with the results. Later, he\u2019ll retouch the photos to remove his tools.\n\n(via moss & fog)\n\nTags: art\u00a0\u00a0 Berndnaut Smilde\u00a0\u00a0 clouds",
