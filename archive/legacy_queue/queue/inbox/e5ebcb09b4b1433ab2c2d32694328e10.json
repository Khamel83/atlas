      "Title": "Kazuo Ishiguro just won the Nobel Prize. Here\u2019s a brief guide to his bleak, beautiful world. Vox - All",
      "Selection": "The 2017 Nobel Prize in literature went to Kazuo Ishiguro, the Japanese-born English novelist who writes lovely, lyrical books about trauma, repression, and survival.\n\nIshiguro\u2019s novels range from the polished and conventional to the sprawling and incoherent, so if you\u2019re new to his work, trying to get a handle on which book does which can be overwhelming. If you\u2019d like to dip into his oeuvre and aren\u2019t sure where to start, this guide is for you.\n\nBeginner level\n\n Knopf\n\nWe\u2019ll begin with Never Let Me Go \u2014 unless you are a science fiction purist, in which case the clone story will only annoy you and you are to head directly to Remains of the Day.\n\nIshiguro has described Never Let Me Go as his most uplifting novel, because it is the only one to feature a wholly sympathetic cast: Kathy H., our narrator, is a thoroughly likable, thoroughly sensible, thoroughly ordinary young girl, which makes what happens to her all the more upsetting. It\u2019s a good place to get your bearings with Ishiguro and figure out how he sees the world.\n\nA word of caution: Do not read Never Let Me Go in public if you do not like to cry in public. \u201cOh,\u201d you might think, \u201cI\u2019ll be that cool person on the train with my book cover tilted just so, so everyone can see I\u2019m reading a Nobel Prize winner \u2014\u201d No. You will not be the smart person reading an acclaimed work of literature that shows the world you are serious and intelligent; you will be that weirdo sitting on the train sobbing over a book. And then when you remember that Ishiguro calls Never Let Me Go his most uplifting work, you\u2019ll be that weirdo hysterically laugh-crying over a book.\n\nFrom there, move along to Remains of the Day, the second of the two most famous Ishiguros: If you hit just those two, you will still be fully qualified to discuss his works at a cocktail party. Remains of the Day is a little colder than Never Let Me Go, and the main character \u2014 an English butler in a manor house around World War II \u2014 is much more warped by the world in which he lives than sweet Kathy H. was. This is Ishiguro delving into monstrosities hidden beneath a stiff British upper lip, and while Remains of the Day may or may not make you cry, it will certainly make you shiver.\n\nIntermediate level\n\n Faber & Faber\n\nThe next step in your Ishiguro education is When We Were Orphans. Ishiguro fans sometimes talk about this one as his hidden gem, the dark horse favorite for his best novel. Its form is more deconstructed than either Never Let Me Go or Remains of the Day: It begins as a detective novel, evolves into a family story, and then gestures at turning into a war story without ever quite doing so; you can feel the narrative becoming less coherent as you slowly lose confidence in the narrator\u2019s ability to understand the world. It\u2019s unsettling and sad to read, with all sorts of dark undercurrents.\n\nNext up is Ishiguro\u2019s most recent novel, 2015\u2019s The Buried Giant. This one led to a public spat with Ursula Le Guin, in which Ishiguro fretted that readers might not understand that he was writing a literary novel with fantasy tropes and Le Guin accused him of condescending to those tropes without fully understanding them.\n\nIshiguro is certainly using his fantasy ideas in a heavily allegorical mode: The Buried Giant is a melancholy story built around the idea of a medieval English legend, with a dragon and a curse, and even readers who love it will tell you straightforwardly that it is a cold and misanthropic book that sees the worst in human nature. Ishiguro\u2019s other books tend to be about fallible human beings who are warped by the world in which they live but are still worthy of empathy and love, but The Buried Giant is about how human beings warp the world themselves.\n\nAdvanced\n\nDepending on whom you ask, Ishiguro\u2019s sprawling 1995 novel The Unconsoled \u2014 with its elliptical dream logic and refusal to even appear to cohere into a recognizable narrative structure \u2014 is either a masterpiece or an incomprehensible wreck. I myself am perfectly willing to believe it a masterpiece if Anita Brookner says it is, but I also have never managed to get past page 275 of 535. You may attempt it with my blessing.\n",
