      "Selection": "\u201cYou rarely learn anything while your mouth is open,\u201d says Simon Letchford, managing director of Scotwork, a consulting company that specializes in corporate negotiations.\n\nThe truism is top of mind right now as he watches US president Donald Trump prep for a summit meeting with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea, over denuclearization. Neither leader is exactly known for his ability to stop talking and listen, Letchford says. But he\u2019s observed executives with decades of negotiation experience in high-pressure situations nevertheless make the same mistake: \u201cThey tend to confuse negotiating with persuasion,\u201d he says.\n\nRather than trying to convince people of your world view, Letchford argues, \u201cthere\u2019s usually much more value to be had in a deal by being curious about the other side\u2019s needs and priorities. And, he adds, you\u2019re more likely to walk away from a bargaining discussion feeling satisfied if you can train your ear for \u201cverbal tells,\u201d which can betray a person\u2019s position in ways they may not be aware of. Paying attention to these easy-to-miss signals can be the difference between reaching a deal or not.\n\nEven the most guarded negotiating partner will offer a few tells\u2014for instance, with word choice. When a person says, \u201cThat would be really difficult,\u201d most of us hear that as a \u201cno,\u201d but we ought to remain curious. As Letchford notes, difficult is not the same as impossible. So ask, \u201cWhat would make that possible?\u201d\n\nThe fact is, we commonly ignore hedging words like \u201cabout\u201d or \u201caround\u201d that we mentally discount as fillers, because we\u2019re primed to pay more attention to negative messages. If someone says, \u201cI need it to come down by about 12%,\u201d says Letchford, \u201cwhat they\u2019re really saying is, \u2018I don\u2019t need 12%.\u2019\u201d\n\nIndeed, one tiny qualifier can radically change the tenor of a discussion. That\u2019s why Carol Dweck, the Stanford University professor behind the \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d theory, encourages managers to tack on the word \u201cyet\u201d when offering feedback, to keep clear \u201ca pathway to the future\u201d that can be signaled to the recipient of the feedback. It\u2019s also just the sort of sentiment that could take a negotiation to a new level, if you\u2019re listening for it.\n\nIn many cases, one sentence will contain several tells that likewise could serve as signposts. Take: \u201cI can\u2019t do that right now,\u201d Letchford offers, which could be interpreted in a handful of ways.\n\nWhat most people will hear is \u201cno,\u201d which would close off unexplored avenues. But a better negotiator will say, \u201cOkay, you can\u2019t do that right now, so maybe later? What would make that happen?\u201d says Letchford. An even more alert negotiator, he continues, would seize on\u00a0the \u201cI.\u201d\u00a0Maybe you need to bring in someone else who can make your request happen. Finally, a champion deal maker would be attuned to the \u201cthat.\u201d If not \u201cthat,\u201d you might respond, is there something else that could be done?\n\nThat kind of listening is a skill that used to come naturally to us, says Letchford. Children, he says, are inherently more curious, and typically not embarrassed to ask questions that reveal what they don\u2019t know. Adults are far more addicted to their own Kool-Aid, and are more fearful of being exposed for not being in the know on something, for instance when they hear an acronym they\u2019ve never encountered before. As we age, Letchford says, we lose \u201cthe art of really actively hearing what the other side is saying.\u201d\n\nIn their training sessions, Scotwork\u2019s consultants will film clients in mock negotiations and analyze the tape with them afterward, looking for missed opportunities. Watching the playback, most people are stunned to see what they missed when they believed they were listening\u2014which is why, Letchford says, it\u2019s always prudent to have an extra pair of ears on a call, or at the table.\n\nLately, computational analyses of large data banks of text have uncovered surprising language patterns. We now know, for instance, that people with depression use certain words more often than others do, including personal pronouns (\u201cI,\u201d \u201cme,\u201d and \u201cmyself\u201d) and absolutist words (\u201calways,\u201d \u201cnothing,\u201d \u201ccompletely\u201d). In minutes, we can detect bias in textbooks and\u00a0measure voter sentiment toward election candidates.\n\nUntil we figure out how to bring the same computational power to the negotiating table, you can train yourself to scan language for patterns just by paying attention.\n",
