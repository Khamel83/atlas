      "Title": "Restaurants Are the New Factories The Atlantic - Business",
      "Selection": "Donald Trump's ideal economy is defined by brawn. He praises steelworkers, speaks wistfully of coal mining, and tweets boastfully about new manufacturing factories. But 200 days into his presidency, the most promising sector of the U.S. labor market isn\u2019t steel-plating. It\u2019s dinner-plating.\n\nRestaurant jobs are on fire in 2017, growing faster than health care, construction, or manufacturing. They account for just 1 percent of the economy, but they\u2019ve accounted for 10 percent of this year\u2019s job growth. The Bureau of Labor Statistics calls this subsector \u201cfood services and drinking places,\u201d and the jobs are mostly at sit-down restaurants, which make up 50 percent of the category. Fast-food joints are the next-largest employer in the category, with 37 percent. Bars\u2014wonderful, plentiful, but leanly staffed\u2014account for just 3 percent. So, I\u2019m just going to keep saying \u201crestaurants\u201d for short.\n\nRestaurants > Health Care\nBLS\n\nIn some metros, restaurants are powering the entire economy. More than a third of Cleveland\u2019s new jobs since 2015 are in restaurants, according to EMSI data. The same is true for New Orleans, but since 2010.\n\nUnlike mining or manufacturing, which tends to cluster in a handful of regions, the restaurant boom is spread across the country. New fine-dining restaurants, which tend to require more waitstaff, are blooming in all the predictable places\u2014San Francisco, Nashville, and Austin (the Texas capital leads the country in percent-growth of restaurant jobs). But restaurants are dominating local economies in a diverse range of places, from poor metros like Little Rock, to rich places like Washington, D.C., and military hubs like Virginia Beach.\n\nThe Restaurants Are Eating the Jobs\nJosh Wright / EMSI\n\nHow did this happen? As Justin Fox points out, the trend didn't appear overnight. For the past three decades, restaurants have steadily grown, as part of the most fundamental shift in American work\u2014from making things to serving people. Between 1990 and 2008, 98 percent of new jobs came from so-called \"nontradable\" industries that aren't sensitive to international trade, according to the economist Michael Spence.\n\nIn 1990, manufacturing was almost three times larger than the food service industry. But restaurants have gradually closed the gap. At current rates of growth, more people will work at restaurants than in manufacturing in 2020. This mirrors the shift in consumer spending. Restaurants\u2019 share of America\u2019s food budget has doubled from 25 percent in the 1950s to 50 percent today.\n\nThe phenomenon is speeding up. Four of the five best years for restaurant growth on record have happened since 2011. Restaurant jobs have grown faster than the overall economy every month since August 2010. (That\u2019s more than 200 consecutive months!) It\u2019s not just a redundant artifact of the service-sector economy, either. Almost every month between 1996 and 2000\u2014years when job creation soared in a booming economy\u2014restaurant jobs grew slower than the rest of the labor market.\n\nThe trend is speeding up, but it\u2019s not clear that we should cheer it\u2014or whether it\u2019s sustainable. Jobs are jobs, but these ones don\u2019t pay very well. The typical private-sector job pays about $22 an hour. The typical restaurant job pays about $12.50. That\u2019s one reason why the Fight for 15 movement to raise the minimum wage has targeted the restaurant industry. What\u2019s more, although it might feel like a golden age of restaurants in America, the truth is that the United States might have too many restaurants, particularly \u201cfamily-casual\u201d chains like Applebee\u2019s, which have struggled to keep up with rising labor costs.\n\nBut the most important feature of the restaurant jobs boom is not what it may say about the future, but rather the fact that it is happening in the first place. Trump and other politicians often say they want to help the common worker. But then they talk about the economy as if it were cryogenically frozen sometime around 1957. The U.S. still makes stuff, but mostly it serves stuff. To help American workers, it helps to begin with an honest accounting of what Americans actually do.",
