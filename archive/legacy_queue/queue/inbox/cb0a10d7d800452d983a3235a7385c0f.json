      "Selection": "Linda Sarsour\u00a0is one of the most powerful social justice activists in the world.\n\nStand in her way, and you\u2019ll quickly find yourself outsmarted\u2014the\u00a0Palestinian Muslim American activist\u2019s\u00a0quick wit and impenetrable perseverance make her, in her own words, \u201cevery Islamophobe\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d Same goes for bigots of any kind.\n\nIn an exclusive Quartz interview, I sat down with Sarsour, one of\u00a0Quartz\u2019s Visionaries, to learn why she, as a \u201cstereotype-shattering muslim woman,\u201d is not an anomaly; how Malcom X\u2019s autobiography teaches her to deal with\u00a0vitriolic Twitter trolls; the importance of her olive-tree bracelets; and why any woman\u2019s sharpest weapon is being unapologetically herself.\n\nBorn and raised in Brooklyn, Sarsour\u2019s career began skyrocketing after 9/11, when she says she first felt \u201cany type of specific direct oppression against myself or my communities,\u201d and began realizing it wasn\u2019t safe to be Muslim in America.\u00a0\n\nToday, she\u2019s\u00a0national co-chair of the Women\u2019s March, and was one of the three co-leaders of what was likely the\u00a0largest single-day demonstration\u00a0in US history.\u00a0\n",
