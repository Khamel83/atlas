      "Title": "Apple\u2019s New High-End Watch Is Crazy Tough. Why Ceramics, Baby WIRED",
      "Selection": "Apple\u2019s using a cool material\u00a0in its latest stable of Watches: ceramic. The shiny white wearable is the new flagship\u00a0model, and starting this Friday you can order one for $1,250. Yes, that\u2019s nine grand cheaper than the $10,000, 18-karat\u00a0gold Apple Watch Edition it replaces, but it\u2019s still about twice the price of the stainless steel Series 2. What do you get for the extra dough, beyond a slick\u00a0look?\n\nToughness, mostly. \u201cCeramics are much more durable than metals,\u201d says\u00a0Julia Greer, a materials scientist at Caltech. To understand what she\u00a0means, consider your MacBook. That\u00a0anodized aluminum casing provides\u00a0a handsome sheen, but drop it and you run a good chance of denting a\u00a0corner. Stick it in your bag unprotected, and your keys almost certainly will scratch it.\n\nThis is why watch nerds love ceramics, and why companies\u00a0like\u00a0Swiss watchmaker Rado have used them since the 1960s.\u00a0Rolex does it, too. So does Chanel. In fact, so does Apple\u2014the back of each Watch uses zirconia ceramic where the magnetic charger attaches. Ceramics are non-conductive, and don\u2019t interfere with wireless charging.\n\nCeramic timepieces are increasingly popular,\u00a0and it\u2019s easy to see why. Literally. Remember when people took to Twitter, Instagram, and Apple forums last year to complain about scratches on their new stainless steel Watches? The\u00a0problem isn\u2019t unique to Apple; all stainless steel watches scratch\u00a0because metals are ductile\u2014materials-scientist-speak that means they deform under stress.\n\nCeramics, on the other hand, are virtually scratch-proof. \u00a0\u201cThey deform in an elastic way,\u201d Greer says. \u201cYou\u2019ll never see the deformation, until they crack.\u201d Unlike an aluminum or a stainless steel case, a ceramic one\u00a0can take a licking and keep on ticking.\u00a0The rub with\u00a0ceramics is that, while they\u2019re tough to scratch, they\u2019re\u00a0more prone\u00a0to cracking compared to metal. \u201cThat\u2019s a tradeoff mother nature usually gives us,\u201d says Desi Kovar, a materials scientist at the Univerisity of Texas-Austin. Generally speaking, the harder and stiffer the material, the more brittle it is.\n\nCeramics are brittle because they\u2019re loaded with\u00a0irregularly distributed pores. These air pockets\u00a0make ceramics lighter, but they\u2019re structural weak points.\u00a0Some ceramics, like bricks, have large pores. \u201cThe larger the pore, the easier it is to break,\u201d Kovar\u00a0says. If you\u2019ve ever broken a ceramic vase or some such,\u00a0the break probably originated at a\u00a0pore.\n\nWatchmakers use a ceramic material with very fine\u00a0pores. It\u2019s called zirconia (zirconium oxide, for any\u00a0chemists in the house), and it\u2019s simultaneously hard and resistant to cracking.\u00a0It also resists changes in\u00a0temperature and moisture, which is why surgeons often use it in\u00a0hip-replacement prosthetics. To bolster its strength (and achieve that bright, white color) Apple added alumina, another ceramic. The result is a material that\u2019s pretty much un-scratchable, and, under most circumstances, unbreakable.\n\nIs it impossible to break? No.\u00a0\u201cBut you\u2019ll probably never experience forces that are high enough to cause fracture,\u201d Greer says.\u00a0That may be true, but at $1,250 it\u2019s best to not test that theory.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGo Back to Top.
