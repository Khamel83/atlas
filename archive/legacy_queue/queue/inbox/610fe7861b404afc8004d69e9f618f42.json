      "Selection": "A couple of drinks a day aren\u2019t bad for you and may even be good for you. \n\nRight? \n\nThat\u2019s been the message \u2014 from researchers, governments, and beverage companies \u2014 for decades. And as a result, many of us don\u2019t think twice about tossing back a couple of glasses or wine or a few beers after work. \n\nBut maybe we should. Because it turns out the story about the health effects of moderate drinking is shifting pretty dramatically. New research on alcohol and mortality, and a growing awareness about the rise in alcohol-related deaths in the US, is causing a reckoning among researchers about even moderate levels of alcohol consumption.\n\nIn particular, an impressive new meta-study involving 600,000 participants, published recently in The Lancet, suggests that levels of alcohol previously thought to be relatively harmless are linked with an earlier death. What\u2019s more, drinking small amounts of alcohol may not carry all the long-touted protective effects on the cardiovascular system. \n\n\u201cFor years, there was a sense that there was an optimal level which was not drinking no alcohol but drinking moderately that led to the best health outcomes,\u201d said Duke University\u2019s Dan Blazer, an author of the paper. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have to rethink that a bit.\u201d\n\nAlongside this study have come disturbing reports of the alcohol industry\u2019s involvement in funding science that may have helped drinking look more favorable, as well as a growing worry that many people are naive about alcohol\u2019s health effects.  How many people know, for example, that as far back as 1988, the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer designated alcohol a level-one carcinogen? Some say too few. \n\nAnd maybe it\u2019s time that changes \u2014 with some caveats, as usual. \n\nThe \u201cFrench paradox,\u201d and why researchers thought a bit of alcohol was good for you\n\nThe story of light drinking as a healthy behavior started to take off in the 1990s, when many researchers believed red wine might be a magical elixir. This idea was known as the \u201cFrench paradox\u201d \u2014 the observation that the French drank lots of wine and had lower rates of cardiovascular disease.\n\nWe now know this was wrong. But that idea was replaced by a narrative suggesting drinking small amounts of any type of alcohol \u2014 no more than one drink a day for women, two for men \u2014 appeared to be linked with modest health and heart benefits. \n\nIn long-term observational studies comparing drinkers and non-drinkers, light to moderate drinkers (who imbibed about one to two units of alcohol a day) often had better health outcomes compared to non-drinkers and heavy drinkers. They had lower rates of heart disease and heart attacks and lived longer. Moderate drinkers also had lower rates of diabetes, another important risk factor for heart disease (although this result is less definitive).\n\nBut there was a problem with these studies: They generally compared drinkers to non-drinkers, instead of comparing lighter drinkers to heavier drinkers. And people who don\u2019t drink are pretty fundamentally different from drinkers in ways that are hard to control for in a study. Their lives probably look pretty dissimilar. But most importantly, they may be sicker at baseline (perhaps they quit drinking because of alcoholism, or because of a health issue like cancer). And something in these differences \u2014 not their avoidance of alcohol \u2014 may have caused them to look like they were in poorer health than the moderate drinkers. (This became known as the \u201csick quitter\u201d problem in the world of alcohol research.)\n\nMore recently, researchers have been trying to overcome that problem by comparing lighter drinkers with heavier drinkers. And the benefits of modest amounts of alcohol wash away.\n\nThe upper safe limit for drinking may be lower than you think \n\nThe most important new study on this was just published in The Lancet. Researchers brought together data on nearly 600,000 current drinkers (again, to overcome the \u201csick quitter\u201d problem) from 83 studies in 19 countries. They wanted to tease out what level of drinking was associated with an increased risk of death and cardiovascular disease. \n\n        Javier Zarracina/Vox\n\nTheir findings were stark: Drinking more than 100 grams of alcohol \u2014 about seven standard glasses of wine or beer \u2014 per week was associated with an increased in risk of death for all causes. In the US, the government suggests men can drink double that amount \u2014 up to two drinks per day \u2014 but advise women who are not pregnant to drink up to one drink per day. \n\nA person\u2019s risk of death shot up as they drank more. People who consumed between seven and 14 drinks per week had a lower life expectancy at age 40 of about six months; people who drank between 14 and 24 drinks per week had one to two years shaved off their lives; and people who imbibed more than 24 drinks a week had a lower life expectancy of four to five years. \n\nYou can see the risk increase in this chart here: \n\n        Lancet\n\n\u201cWe wanted to find how much alcohol people can drink before they started being at a higher risk of dying,\u201d said the lead author on the study, Cambridge University biostatistics professor Angela Wood. \u201cOur results suggest an upper safe limit of drinking of around 100g of alcohol per week for men and for women. Drinking above this limit was related to lower life expectancy.\u201d\n\nAgain, that\u2019s different from the US guidelines, which suggest men can drink double that. The recommended upper limits of alcohol consumption in Italy, Portugal, and Spain are about 50 percent higher than the seven-drinks-per-week threshold the paper revealed. \n\nThe researchers also estimated that men who halved their alcohol consumption \u2014 from about 14 drinks per week to about seven \u2014 might gain one to two years in life expectancy. \n\nWhat\u2019s more, because they looked at so many studies on so many people, they were able to tease out alcohol\u2019s effects on a number of measures of cardiovascular health \u2014 heart attack, heart failure, stroke. They found moderate alcohol consumption \u2014 around seven to 14 drinks per week \u2014 was associated with a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease according to some of the measures they looked at, including stroke, aortic aneurysm, and heart failure\u200b. These risks were generally higher for the people who drank more. \n\nThe exception was non-fatal heart attacks. The more people drank, the more their risk of heart attack went down. The researchers thought this may be driven by the fact that people who drink more tend to have high levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol \u2014 or the \u201cgood cholesterol\u201d \u2014 which could put them at a lower risk of dying from a heart attack. \n\nBut that benefit should be balanced against alcohol\u2019s other cardiovascular risks, including stroke, aortic aneurysm, and heart failure, said Eastern Virginia Medical School researcher Andrew Plunk. \u201cEven though there might be some benefit for heart attacks, the other risks associated with it wash that out,\u201d he added. \n\nNewer research is finding similar associations with moderate levels of drinking. In a forthcoming paper, posted to BioRXiv, researchers took a similar approach to tease out the risks of drinking \u2014 using moderate drinkers instead of non-drinkers as the reference point to circumvent the \u201csick quitter\u201d problem once again. The paper is only in pre-print and still needs to be peer-reviewed, but for now, its authors came to similar conclusions as the Lancet study, even though they used a different set of data. \n\nMore specifically, people who had one to two drinks four times or more weekly had a greater risk of dying from all causes than those who drank one to two drinks at a time weekly or less. And again, there was no difference between male and female study participants, which contradicts US government guidelines. \n\n\u201cWhen the reference point is never-drinkers, it looks like you can drink a lot before you have an increased risk,\u201d said Washington University School of Medicine substance dependence researcher Sarah Hartz, the lead author on the BioRXiv pre-print. \u201cBut if the reference is light drinkers, it looks like any amount of drinking will increase your risk.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat we need to keep in mind is that alcohol is dangerous\u201d\n\nBefore you empty out your liquor cabinet, however, there are a few important things to keep in mind. Nutrition science \u2014 including research on the effects of alcohol \u2014 is still in its infancy. There\u2019s a lot even the best studies can\u2019t tell us. What were the lives of the study participants like? How do they eat? Where did they live? Did they exercise? The supplementary material in the Lancet paper suggests these and other potential confounding factors may have been pretty important in determining people\u2019s alcohol-associated health risks.\n\nFor example, in a subgroup analysis on the effects of alcohol by alcohol type, the Lancet authors found that spirit and beer drinkers seemed to have a higher risk of death and cardiovascular disease compared to wine drinkers. But they also found that beer and spirit drinkers looked pretty different from the wine drinkers: They were more likely to be lower income, male, and smokers and to have jobs that involved manual labor, compared with the wine drinkers.\n\n\u201cThese findings suggest that the heavy beer consumption is part of an unhealthy lifestyle that is more frequently seen among people with lower socioeconomic status,\u201d said Cecile Janssens, a research professor of epidemiology at Emory University. \u201cUnhealthy diet, smoking, less exercise, less access to health care, etc., might all contribute to the higher risks.\u201d So you\u2019d need to take these other factors into account to truly understand the risks of alcohol consumption. And it\u2019s possible that just cutting back alcohol, in this context, wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference in their life expectancy. \n\nPlus, Blazer said, \u201cif you try to abide by every public health warning out there for every adverse effect, you\u2019d have a miserable life. You wouldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d \n\nNonetheless, the new research is a reminder of something we often forget: Alcohol\u2019s health effects are real, and they are serious. Drinking increases the risk of everything from liver disease to high blood pressure, dependency issues, and memory and mental health problems. As Vox\u2019s German Lopez has reported, alcohol-related deaths have been going up in America \u2014 an underappreciated fact that\u2019s been lost in the coverage of opioids.   \n\n\u201cNot a lot of people know alcohol is a level-one carcinogen,\u201d Harvard Medical School addiction researcher John F. Kelly told me. Any amount of drinking is associated with an increased breast cancer risk \u2014 something journalist Stephanie Mencimer admitted in Mother Jones she didn\u2019t know until she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. \u201cWhile doctors have frequently admonished me for putting cream in my coffee lest it clog my arteries ... not once has any doctor suggested I might face a higher cancer risk if I didn\u2019t cut back on drinking,\u201d she wrote. For men and women, drinking is also known to increase the risk of mouth, throat, esophagus, liver, and colon cancer. \n\nBut when the weekend rolls around, and you want to cut loose, it\u2019s not easy to face up to these facts. Alcohol is a huge part of our culture, and the problems it can carry aren\u2019t always easy to swallow. But these new studies should sound a cautionary note, Blazer said.\n\n\u201cThe idea that I can drink three drinks per day and it\u2019ll help me live longer \u2014 I think you have to eliminate that from your thinking. What we need to keep in mind is that alcohol is dangerous \u2014 and the danger of alcohol doesn\u2019t receive the attention it deserves.\u201d  \n",
