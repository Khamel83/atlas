      "Selection": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk today shared the first video of what he calls a \u201crelease candidate\u201d version of Tesla\u2019s upcoming Model 3 electric car. We\u2019ve seen Model 3 prototypes before, and this five-second clip doesn\u2019t really show us anything new \u2014 but Musk enjoys feeding the hype train.\n\nHe also noted that calling the new car the \u201cModel 3\u201d was sowing confusion among customers about whether it was the \u201cnext version\u201d of Tesla\u2019s car, like Apple going from the iPhone 2 to iPhone 3 \u2014 \u201cnot true,\u201d Musk said.\n\nHe called himself \u201ca dumb idiot\u201d for naming it Model 3, saying he \u201cdidn\u2019t realize at the time that it would cause confusion.\u201d Instead, he says customers should think of the Model 3 as similar to the BMW 3 Series or Audi A4, while the Model S is like a BMW 5 or 6 Series \u2014 different cars but sold side by side. Musk noted that he will keep driving the Model S even after the Model 3 arrives.\n\nIn an anecdote we\u2019ve known for a while, Musk reminded followers that the Model 3 was originally going to be named the Model E (\u201cfor obvious dumb humor reasons\u201d \u2014 meaning the cars would be Models S, E, and X), but a Ford trademark lawsuit prevented that from happening. Next up, naturally, is Model Y. S3XY.\n\nFirst drive of a release candidate version of Model 3 http://pic.twitter.com/zcs6j1YRa4\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2017\n\nAs part of his tweetstorm this morning \u2014 which occurred during a flight to Cape Canaveral for a SpaceX rocket launch \u2014 Musk replied to a number of current and potential Tesla customers about what\u2019s coming from the company in the coming months. Among other things, he said:\n\nThe first Model 3 cars will all be rear-wheel drive, much like the Model S was, to make production a bit simpler. All-wheel drive / dual-motor versions will come six to nine months after launch.\n\nPerformance versions of the Model 3 will come \u201cprobably a year from now,\u201d though the Model S will remain faster because it has room for a larger battery.\n\n\u201cMore cowbell\u201d will be coming in the Tesla 8.1 software update, which is expected next week. It\u2019s a reference to a Will Farrell Saturday Night Live skit of which Musk is a fan. Previous versions of Tesla\u2019s vehicle operating system have included Easter eggs referencing cowbell.\n\nThe Model 3 will have a single screen combining instrument cluster and infotainment information in one place. Hinting at possible increased autonomy, Musk asked how often riders look at the instrument panel in a taxi.\n\n@arctechinc The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?\n\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 24, 2017\n\nThe Model S will remain the fastest Tesla until the next-generation Roadster is released \u2014 though that car is \u201ca few years away.\u201d\n\nA Tesla semi-truck will beat sports cars from zero to 60 mph.\n\nTesla and SolarCity will begin taking orders for its \u201csolar roof\u201d product next month.\n",
