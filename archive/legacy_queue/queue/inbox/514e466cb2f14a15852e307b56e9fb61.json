      "Selection": "MacKenzie Scott (then Bezos) at an awards ceremony in 2018. | J\u00f6rg Carstensen/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nIn the past year, she\u2019s given away $1.7 billion.\n\nA year ago, Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos set records with the world\u2019s biggest divorce settlement. On July 28, MacKenzie Bezos (now MacKenzie Scott) announced that she\u2019s spent the time since aiming to set a much more inspiring record \u2014 for how fast she can give the money away.\n\nWhen the couple divorced in 2019, they were splitting the largest personal fortune in history, estimated at the time at about $145 billion. The couple announced a settlement in April 2019 that left Jeff Bezos 75 percent of his Amazon fortune, while Scott departed the marriage with $35 billion, making her at the time of the announcement the third-richest woman in the world (a recent Forbes ranking now has her at fourth).\n\nRight away, Scott indicated that her approach to philanthropy would be profoundly different from the approach she and Bezos had used as a couple. Jeff Bezos\u2019s forays into philanthropy have been limited. While the wealthiest man in the world, he has not signed the Giving Pledge to eventually donate a significant share of his wealth, and he\u2019s donated a far smaller percentage of it than other ultra-wealthy figures like Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, or Mike Bloomberg. When he has given, I\u2019ve criticized his approach for a lack of rigor and clarity.\n\nOne month after the divorce, Scott signed the Giving Pledge that Bezos never did. \u201cI have a disproportionate amount of money to share,\u201d she wrote in her pledge letter. \u201cI won\u2019t wait. And I will keep at it until the safe is empty.\u201d And it seems like she\u2019s been acting on that declaration.\n\nMacKenzie Scott\u2019s deeply unusual approach to philanthropy\n\nA year later, she has published an update, and it\u2019s an astonishing one. In the past year, she has donated $1.7 billion to 116 organizations working in areas of interest to her, from racial justice and LGBTQ equality to climate change and global health.\n\nAll the organizations listed are established nonprofits, selected, Scott says, for their leadership\u2019s \u201ctrack record of effective management and significant impact in their fields.\u201d The largest area of grants \u2014 $586.7 million \u2014 went to organizations working on racial equity, an issue where awareness has grown quickly over the past few months amid protests sparked by George Floyd\u2019s killing by Minneapolis police. Other top priorities included economic mobility ($399.5 million), gender equity, public health, and global development (more on these below).\n\nThe total amount \u2014 $1.7 billion \u2014 is obviously just a fraction of her fortune, but it is deeply unusual for billionaires to give away that much money this quickly, especially without a preexisting organization to do grant research and vetting.\n\nHer methods, too, are unusual. \u201cIt was a gift that just fell from the sky,\u201d Jorge Valencia, executive director and CEO of one of those 116 organizations, the Point Foundation, told the Chronicle of Philanthropy. The organization, which offers scholarships to LGBTQ+ students, did not apply for a grant and had no connection to Scott.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s common for philanthropists to give grants that are restricted for a specific purpose, paid out over the course of several years or conditional on various benchmarks for grant success, Scott says she did none of that. \u201cI gave each a contribution and encouraged them to spend it on whatever they believe best serves their efforts. Unless organization leadership requested otherwise, all commitments were paid up front and left unrestricted to provide them with maximum flexibility,\u201d she wrote in her announcement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting contrast to the more technocratic giving of the tech billionaires,\u201d Rob Reich, a Stanford philosopher who writes about the role of philanthropy in society, told me.\n\nAnother interesting contrast is the way Scott approached publicizing her giving. The announcement two years ago that Jeff Bezos planned to give $2 billion to education and homelessness charities attracted, Reich says, \u201cfanfare with zero follow-up.\u201d Almost two years later, the website for Bezos\u2019s Day One Fund lists just under $200 million in grants, about 10 percent of the amount initially pledged. Half of the initial pledge was for education, and no progress in this area has been officially announced yet (though Bezos has posted updates on Instagram).\n\nIn 2020, Bezos announced on Instagram a planned $10 billion in grants to fight climate change through what he called the Bezos Earth Fund. The Bezos Earth Fund has no website. Bezos\u2019s original Instagram post says that grants will start this summer, though they appear to have not yet started.\n\nAll this is not unusual (and it doesn\u2019t suggest that Bezos won\u2019t eventually meet his commitments; he has paid out other grants he\u2019s made, including $100 million to Feeding America for coronavirus relief earlier this year). Typically, philanthropic announcements get widespread coverage even if they are substantially in advance of the actual disbursement of money. And in some cases, money is disbursed to donor-advised funds or other instruments, which means they may take even longer to reach recipients. There is nothing wrong with taking your time to make grants if that means the grants do more good \u2014 but it\u2019s easy for delays to mean that givers enjoy all the positive publicity of a major grant long before anyone\u2019s life is improved by it.\n\nScott, by announcing her gifts only after she\u2019d already disbursed all the money, avoids that pitfall \u2014 and could offer a glimpse of a new model of how to give, one that is focused on moving money quickly, not attaching any requirements or conditions, and shifting the power dynamics of the philanthropy world.\n\nDoes this model of giving work?\n\nScott\u2019s fast, massive disbursements and other recent experiments in quickly moving large sums of money to where they are needed, with much less review and fewer application steps than in traditional grantmaking, \u201cweakens the case that giving away $1.7 billion is difficult,\u201d Reich said. \u201cThere remains a question about whether it\u2019s difficult to do well.\u201d\n\nGiving away money very quickly with a minimal process does have some disadvantages.\n\nMany charitable interventions don\u2019t work, and the differences between the best organizations and the average organizations can be quite large. It\u2019s reasonable that many funders don\u2019t want to take that chance.\n\nBut there\u2019s a good argument that at least some funders should be happy to make lots of grants, many of which may disappoint them anyway. Vetting often adds lots of overhead, delays, and communication problems for charities; a faster process that gets money where it\u2019s needed sooner can make a big difference. In some specific fields (say, scientific research), studies have shown that all the effort-intensive work to find the \u201cbest\u201d grants is fairly arbitrary; researchers don\u2019t agree with each other\u2019s rankings at all. In a case like that, you might as well just get money out the door, with minimal vetting \u2014 as Scott has done.\n\nAnd in some areas, like coronavirus relief, getting money to people quickly is really important. If it takes months to make a grant and more months for the money to arrive, it may be too late to help. Scott donated to GiveDirectly, a nonprofit that gives people cash, no strings attached, and which has dramatically expanded its operations this year in order to help people around the world deal with the coronavirus crisis.\n\nScott\u2019s team reached out to GiveDirectly after having already done their research, GiveDirectly\u2019s managing director Joe Huston told me. Very little staff time was tied up in making the donation happen. (The nonprofit tracks how many resources are expended per dollar raised and said that Scott\u2019s gift was one of the lowest-scoring, on that metric, they could remember.) The money arrived in early June, and 95 percent of it was sent out to recipients within 10 days.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic is giving donors experience in handing over the reins in philanthropy,\u201d Huston told me, so that help can reach people as fast as it\u2019s needed. \u201cMy hope is that when people are just looking to help, they\u2019ll start with that in general.\u201d\n\nThere are other pitfalls to trying to give away money quickly, though Scott avoided many of the biggest ones. Lots of donors making large gifts gravitate toward targets like Stanford, Harvard, or MIT \u2014 big research universities with well-staffed donor relations departments that can absorb enormous gifts. (\u201cFor the love of God, rich people, stop giving Ivy League colleges money,\u201d my colleague Dylan Matthews wrote after one such mega-gift, and I agree.) Scott donated to several historically Black colleges and universities; in each case, her donation of $20 million to $40 million was the largest single donation in the school\u2019s history.\n\nThe money will help \u201dlift the financial burden off of deserving students and help make ends meet so they can focus on graduating on time,\u201d Howard University said in a statement. \u201cThis pure act of benevolence is clearly a game-changer and it could not have come at a better time,\u201d Hampton president William R. Harvey told the HBCU Digest.\n\nIn general, picking organizations run by people affected firsthand by the injustices Scott targeted was a priority. \u201cOn this list, 91 percent of the racial-equity organizations are run by leaders of color, 100 percent of the LGBTQ+ equity organizations are run by LGBTQ+ leaders, and 83 percent of the gender-equity organizations are run by women, bringing lived experience to solutions for imbalanced social systems,\u201d she wrote in her note announcing the gifts.\n\nThat fact might provide a useful lens for evaluating her donations. MacKenzie Scott does not know how to solve racial justice, women\u2019s rights, or LGBTQ+ equality. She just happens to, unlike most of us, be in possession of $35 billion, and so she decided that if she gave much of that money to Black activists and LGBTQ+ activists and women\u2019s activists, probably they would be better suited than she is to figure out how the money could be spent to solve those problems.\n\nThe same theme recurs in Scott\u2019s letter and in nonprofits\u2019 descriptions of her process. There wasn\u2019t very much vetting because Scott does not particularly expect that she\u2019s better at vetting than these organizations are. There weren\u2019t restrictions on the grants because Scott does not particularly believe she\u2019s more suited than the recipients to guess what restrictions would be useful. She is \u201ctrusting the leaders of the organizations chosen,\u201d Reich told me, \u201cwith a very deliberate eye toward leaders with the lived experience of the work they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something deeply inspiring about that. I am in favor of philanthropists putting in the work to identify the most effective approaches to social problems and direct their money with precision where it will do the most good, when they have the resources to do that. I think that work is often well worth the effort.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s room for the bigger foundations, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, that kind of heavyweight model,\u201d Huston told me when I asked whether more philanthropists should be imitating Scott. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad there\u2019s more examples, like [MacKenzie] Bezos, like Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey,\u201d where philanthropists make donation decisions quickly and trust the decision-making to others.\n\nIf you have $35 billion, that fact does not in itself make you qualified to figure out how to fix the world \u2014 and if you think that other people are more qualified, you might decide the best plan is to just shovel the money out the door so they can run with it. That seems to be MacKenzie Scott\u2019s approach to philanthropy so far \u2014 and a society grappling with the role of billionaires in our world and in our giving should be watching.\n\nSign up for the Future Perfect newsletter and we\u2019ll send you a roundup of ideas and solutions for tackling the world\u2019s biggest challenges \u2014 and how to get better at doing good.\n\nSupport Vox\u2019s explanatory journalism\n\nEvery day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.
