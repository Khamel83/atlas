      "Title": "The idea that a woman\u2019s fertility plummets at age 35 comes from bad science Quartz",
      "Selection": "As an unmarried woman approaching 30, I\u2019m increasingly aware of the looming biological deadline that might make it difficult to have both a career and a family. Or at least what I thought was the biological deadline.\n\nIn fact, as this video shows, the belief that you\u2019re taking a lot of risk with your fertility if you wait to have kids after age 35 is simply not true.\n\nThere is no cliff at 35. In fact, fertility is very dependent on the individual. Some women will have more trouble than others getting pregnant, regardless of age. There is a slow decline in fertility, and an increase in the risk of birth defects, but it\u2019s less dramatic than we\u2019ve been led to believe. There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all advice that can pinpoint the perfect moment to have a child, and it\u2019s bad science to suggest otherwise.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve seen myths like this become conventional wisdom. Time and again, the difficulty of balancing work and family has proven to be a ripe target for what some aptly dub the Woman Panic Industry. And at the dawn of the 21st Century, that meant warnings to women that pursuing a career meant playing Russian roulette with your biological clock.\n\nIn 2002, economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett, author of Creating a Life: Professional Women and the Quest For Children, claimed career women were suffering a \u201ccrisis of childlessness.\u201d At the same time, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, the nation\u2019s largest professional organization of fertility specialists, released an ad campaign featuring an upside down baby bottle in the shape of an hour glass, running out of milk. The group warned that a woman\u2019s chance of pregnancy was just 20% each month at age 30, and dwindled to a worrying 5% by age 40. The society still reports these numbers.\n\n(The Society claims not to know where their alarming data comes from. The best its spokesperson could tell me was, \u201cThe patient materials were developed by a committee, the membership of which has changed over time and I have not been able to discover the source for them.\u201d We did discover the source of these statistics, and, as you\u2019ll see in the video, it\u2019s astonishing that such flimsy data has crept into so much of contemporary medical advice.)\n\nBut it\u2019s no wonder we\u2019re so easily panicked. The fearful narrative around women\u2019s fertility fits with a broader theme that\u2019s become all too common as women have gained economic independence over the last several decades: we\u2019re going to pay for our equality. Mothers going to work in the 1980\u2019s were told they were subjecting their kids to an epidemic of sexual abuse at daycare centers. In 1986, Newsweek reported that 40-year-old single women were \u201cmore likely to be killed by a terrorist\u201d than find a husband. These stories and many more like them, of course, are completely false. Perhaps the best way to fight the panic is to question those who\u2019ve made a business of selling it.\n\nThis video report was produced in collaboration with Retro Report. Here\u2019s our first story in the series.\n\nWatch this next: Myths of the \u201cmommy wars\u201d\n",
