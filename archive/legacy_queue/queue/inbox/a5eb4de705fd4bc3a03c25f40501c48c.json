      "Selection": "Baltimore Crime Beat - \u201cWire\u201d creator responds to top cop\u2019s criticism - Baltimore crime news: Police, courts and police stories in the city and central Maryland - baltimoresun.com\n\n\n\u201cThe Wire\u201d creator David Simon, during a break between dubbing sessions for season two of \u201cTreme,\u201d responds to comments made recently by Police Commissioner Frederick H. Bealefeld III that the HBO show was a \u201csmear that will take decades to overcome,\u201d reviving a debate that took place throughout the show\u2019s run:\n\nIt is my understanding that Commissioner Bealefeld - by finally choosing to emphasize the quality, rather than the quantity of arrest - has been able to reduce the homicide rate somewhat in our city. If true, this is not only commendable, it is a long time coming. Too long, in fact.\u00a0\n\nInterestingly, the newspaper that covered his department began making the argument to do exactly that as early as 1994, in a series of articles entitled \u201cCrisis In Blue\u201d (Ed. note: part two can be found here) that carefully articulated the disconnect between the Baltimore department\u2019s aggressive street-level prosecution of the drug war and the root causes of violence in the city. The arguments were furthered in a book entitled \u201cThe Corner\u201d that was published three years later. After a new election cycle, however, those arguments were ignored in favor of years of \u201czero tolerance\u201d of minor street crimes and an obsession with street-level drug enforcement that actually de-emphasized quality police work and led to marked declines in arrest rates for major felonies. \u00a0\n\nLater, when a mayor sought to become governor using public safety as an issue, the same police department went further down the path, emphasizing widespread street arrests of dubious quality and legality. This did not reduce crime so much as it violated the civil rights of many city residents and led to the widespread alienation of our jury pool, with many city jurors no longer willing to trust the integrity of testifying officers - a problem that will plague Baltimore law enforcement for years.\n\nFurthermore, on behalf of Mr. O\u2019Malley\u2019s political aspirations, many supervisors in many police districts were engaged in a prolonged campaign to improperly downgrade U.C.R. felonies to misdemeanors so as to further the political claim that crime was under control. This was common knowledge throughout the department and was much remarked upon privately by respected veteran supervisors and investigators, themselves frustrated at the practice. Nonetheless, aggravated assaults became common assaults. Armed robberies became larcenies. Rapes were unfounded.\n\nI do not recall that Commissioner Bealefeld - when he was rising through the ranks during those years - made strenuous public objection to the department\u2019s misdirection, to its statistical flummery, or to the decline in arrest rates that resulted as quality police work was de-emphasized in favor of juked stats. \u00a0Perhaps he did so in private, to little avail. And perhaps now that he is in a position to act, he is taking a better path. Again, as a resident of Baltimore, he has my wholehearted support if this is the case.\n\nBut publicly, let me state that The Wire owes no apologies \u2014 at least not for its depiction of those portions of Baltimore where we set our story, for its address of economic and political priorities and urban poverty, for its discussion of the drug war and the damage done from that misguided prohibition, or for its attention to the cover-your-ass institutional dynamic that leads, say, big-city police commissioners to perceive a fictional narrative, rather than actual, complex urban problems as a cause for righteous concern. As citizens using a fictional narrative as a means of arguing different priorities or policies, those who created and worked on The Wire have dissented.\nCommissioner Bealefeld may not be comfortable with public dissent, or even a public critique of his agency. He may even believe that the recent decline in crime entitles him to denigrate as \u201cstupid\u201d or \u201cslander\u201d all prior dissent, as if the previous two decades of mismanagement in the Baltimore department had not happened and should not have been addressed by any act of storytelling, given that Baltimore is no longer among the most violent American cities, but merely a very violent one.\nOthers might reasonably argue, however that it is not sixty hours of The Wire that will require decades for our city to overcome, as the commissioner claims. A more lingering problem might be two decades of bad performance by a police agency more obsessed with statistics than substance, with appeasing political leadership rather than seriously addressing the roots of city violence, with shifting blame rather than taking responsibility.\u00a0 That is the police department we depicted in The Wire, give or take our depiction of some conscientious officers and supervisors. And that is an accurate depiction of the Baltimore department for much of the last twenty years, from the late 1980s, when cocaine hit and the drug corners blossomed, until recently, when Mr. O\u2019Malley became governor and the pressure to clear those corners without regard to legality and to make crime disappear on paper finally gave way to some normalcy and, perhaps, some police work. \u00a0Commissioner Bealefeld, who was present for much of that history, knows it as well as anyone associated with The Wire.\nWe made things up, true. \u00a0We have never claimed otherwise. \u00a0But respectfully, with regard to our critique, we have slandered no one. \u00a0And to the extent you can stand behind a fictional tale, we stand by ours - and more importantly, our purpose in telling that tale.\nRespectfully,\nDavid Simon\nBaltimore, MD",
