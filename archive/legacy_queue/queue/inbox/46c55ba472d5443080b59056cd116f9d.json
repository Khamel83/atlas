      "Selection": "Typically, when we think of Cairo, the last things that would probably come to mind are jingle bells\u00a0or Jack Frost nipping\u00a0at our noses. We\u2019d probably think more about regular prayer calls from the neighborhood mosques and a Sphinx with a nipped nose.\n\nThe Sphinx (Photo by Kitti Boonnitrod / Getty Images)\n\nHowever, one of the most fantastic things about Cairo in December is the love the locals have for the Christmas season. So, if Cairo wasn\u2019t on your list of travels for this season, it may just need to be added. In fact, TPG says this could be the time to add Egypt back to your bucket list\u00a0\u2014 especially because of its newly discovered chamber of mummies\u00a0and 4,000-year-old Egyptian tomb.\n\nTis the season in this typically tropical country and here are five things you probably don\u2019t know about Christmas in this amazing ancient city!\n\n1. Cairo Has a Fantastic Ice-skating Rink\n\nWhat better way to experience a winter wonderland than going ice skating? Nestled within the Cairo Festival City Mall in New Cairo, \u201cIce Land\u201d gives all the feeling of the Christmas season. Made of a synthetic material, the rink allows everyone of all ages to come and enjoy this favorite winter pastime while indoors. There\u2019s also a second location in Point 90 Mall, which is situated across the street from the American University of Cairo. Here, you can catch a game of ice hockey or even a performance from professional \u201cDisney on Ice\u201d figure skaters.\n\n2. Sales, Sales\u00a0and More Sales\n\nOne of the best parts about being in Cairo during the Christmas season is that there are always massive sales. From mall to mall, you\u2019ll find some of your favorite brands at extremely discounted prices. It\u2019s like having Black Friday every day during the month of December. And, with the Egyptian pound substantially lower than other currencies, your money can go a lot further picking up gifts and knickknacks for everyone. You may need to head to Khan El Khalili (Old Cairo) and pick up an extra piece of luggage for the flight home!\n\nYou can purchase hand-crafted Christmas ornaments at markets in Cairo.

In fact, Cairo is the first city in the world with this option. This feature can be found under the same settings as UberX, Select and Scooter. With this option, you can literally bring the whole family and enjoy some of the fantastic sights during your holiday break without hailing multiple taxis or paying for a driver. In Egypt, you can pay for Uber with cash and for longer distance rides (45 minutes to an hour), you\u2019ll still only pay about $7 to $10.\n\n4. Don\u2019t Be Fooled by the Daytime Weather\n\nAlthough the temperatures boast spring-like weather in December, as the evening approaches, it\u2019ll begin to feel a lot like Christmas. OK, maybe just a little. But do be sure to carry a jacket, sweater or extra layer because temperatures fall about 10 to 20 degrees at night. However, with the multitude of coffee and tea shops, you\u2019ll be sure to warm up in no time.\n\nNighttime in Cairo (Photo by Emad Aljumah / Getty Images)\n\n5. Cairo Celebrates Two Christmases!\n\nYes, you read that correctly. The beauty of celebrating Christmas in Cairo is that western Christmas (Dec. 25) is observed, as well as Coptic Christmas (Jan, 7). For the entire month of December and through the New Year, you and the family can enjoy the Christmas spirit with the vast array of decorations and celebrations.\n\nCelebrating Coptic Christmas in Cairo (Photo by Khaled Desouki / Getty Images)\n\nThis year, The Nile Ritz-Carlton, Cairo (currently just 35k Marriott Rewards points per night \u2014 so use a Marriott 35k certificate) will host daily activities from Dec. 23 through Jan. 7. This will include everything from your favorite Christmas indulgences, like gingerbread houses and eggnog, a Christmas movie viewing schedule, to a \u201cChristmas Wonderland\u201d-themed party. There\u2019ll also be an appearance from Santa himself in the Lobby Lounge on Dec. 25.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Cairo next Christmas, you may want to stay at the new St. Regis Cairo (set to open in early 2019), as it is also a Category 5 property in the Marriott Rewards program. This means that the annual certificates from cards such as the\u00a0Marriott Rewards Premier Plus Credit Card\u00a0or\u00a0Starwood Preferred Guest\u00ae Credit Card from American Express\u00a0can really come in handy for a bit of luxury while enjoying the holiday spirit on a budget in Cairo.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIf visiting Cairo during the Christmas break is on your list, you can apply for your entry visa, in advance. The process is very simple, but be sure to give yourself a minimum of two weeks to apply before your trip. Otherwise, Egypt also offers the option of purchasing your visa upon arrival for $25 per person, before reaching border patrol. Also, with it being peak season around the holidays, give yourself enough time to book your flights, accommodations and tours.\n\nHave you been to Cairo at Christmastime?
