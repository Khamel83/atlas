Each story is written as it was told to her. Bala says that by listening to their stories, she hopes to bear witness to her subjects\u2019 lives, providing them with an outlet, a judgment-free ear, and a sense of catharsis. By sharing them, she hopes to facilitate acceptance and understanding of issues that are seldom publicly discussed, at the risk of fear, stigma, and ostracism. Read more here.

I was so thrilled on our wedding day\u2014it felt like the beginning of a new life for us. We had plans to travel and buy a home, and we agreed that we both wanted children down the road. But\u2026we still felt so young; we were in no rush.\n\nAfter we\u2019d been married for about a year, I started to notice that all of my friends were having babies. I\u2019d been completely oblivious to the \u201ctimelines\u201d and the \u201cticking biological clocks\u201d that women supposedly feel once they\u2019re in their thirties. I decided that I wasn\u2019t really \u201cready\u201d to be a mom, mostly because I didn\u2019t have that \u201cfeeling\u201d that women so often describe. I didn\u2019t think that childbearing was magical: I was afraid what it would do to my body. I was afraid of breastfeeding; I was afraid of dropping the baby; I was afraid I wouldn\u2019t rise to the challenge of motherhood.\n\nBut I think, most of all, I was afraid of what a baby would do to our marriage. My husband and I were always so in love; we were best friends. We shared common interests and hobbies. We loved hiking and being outdoors\u2014how would a baby fit into that? Would I become consumed, forced to leave us on the back-burner? Would we become one of those couples who stayed together for the sake of the children\u2014who went out for a rare date night and spent the hour eating in silence?\n\nI feel like this is typical of men: because I wasn\u2019t leading the charge on wanting to get pregnant, my husband stayed happily mum. Two more years passed before our families got involved and people started asking questions\u2014why aren\u2019t you trying to get pregnant? When can we expect a grandchild? Soon you\u2019ll be too old to have kids\u2014your body will not bounce back as easily as it once could have. And I\u2019d love to say that we were focusing on our careers, or that we had a plan, or that we had just changed our minds and didn\u2019t want children. But that wasn\u2019t the truth: the truth is that we were just failing to start. Neither of us felt strongly enough to actually try. We just got complacent. We were afraid of change.\n\nWe bought a home. We settled into careers. We neared our mid-thirties. And we ran out of excuses.\n\nSo we started trying to conceive. \u201cOne and done,\u201d my husband boasted that first time. But I got my period, and his enthusiasm dissipated. The second time around, I started paying more attention to my body. I downloaded an application and tracked my cycle. Again, no baby. But that was fine: I\u2019d read that it takes the average couple about six months to conceive. Because I was already in my mid-thirties, if we weren\u2019t pregnant by six months, I\u2019d have to go in to check that I wasn\u2019t having fertility issues.\n\nBy month four, I had everything down to a science. I had ovulation kits and basal body thermometers, and I\u2019d taught myself how to read my cervical mucus. My husband complained that I was taking the romance out of baby making but I didn\u2019t really listen: it was so unlike me to not be good at something, especially something that was supposed to be as \u201cnatural\u201d and easy as having a baby.\n\nMonth four turned out to be my month. I ran through my cache of pregnancy tests and got one positive after another. We celebrated but decided to keep the news to ourselves since miscarriages are common before 12 weeks. And it\u2019s a good thing that we did, because about eight weeks into the pregnancy, I miscarried.\n\nAnd then I miscarried again. And again. And again. Five times over the next two years. I felt exhausted and beaten. My body felt a mess. My hormones had the run of the place, and our marriage started to fall apart. It wasn\u2019t so much the repeated losses\u2014although those were difficult\u2014but the fact that I became totally consumed with just getting pregnant. It became the one thing I couldn\u2019t do, and naturally, the only thing I ever wanted. I\u2019d get my hopes up every single time; he didn\u2019t. I think that to protect himself, he became detached. Every time I failed, I felt crushed. And he felt a little farther away.\n\nHe moved out of the house. We chose not to get a divorce. We went to therapy. We were cordial. Everything was very mature\u2014we just weren\u2019t in love anymore. And then he told me that he met someone. And then he got her pregnant. And then\u2026she was born. And she is beautiful.\n\nFor a very long time, I felt that I would never be happy again. But life goes on, with or without you. I took our savings and went to a fertility specialist. I picked a donor, got inseminated, and then I held my breath for eight weeks. And then for twelve. And then for sixteen. When she was born, I finally breathed again. And she is beautiful, too.\n\nRead more Craigslist Confessionals here. To share your story with Helena, email her at craigslistconfessionalqz@gmail.com.
