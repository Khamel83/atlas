      "Selection": "Welcome to Nifty, Gifty Holidays, our guide for all the little, magical ways we make the season sparkle. Today, we\u2019re tapping a professional gift stylist for tips on perfecting our present-wrapping game.\n\nDo your presents end up wrapped in helplessly wrinkled paper and lopsided little bows? While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, we can\u2019t help but admit there\u2019s something incredibly satisfying about handing over an impeccably wrapped gift during the holidays (and year-round!).\n\nIf you struggle to wrap presents each year\u2014or just want to up your game to impress your friends and family\u2014we\u2019ve got a treat for you. Toronto-based gift stylist Corrina vanGerwen was kind enough to let us pick her brain about what it takes to create a showstopping gift, and her pro tips are pretty ingenious, if we do say so ourselves.\n\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about picking wrapping paper, executing proper technique, embellishing gifts, and more.\n\nBetter Materials, Better Wrapping\n\nAs with any craft, you\u2019ll have an easier time creating a beautiful present if you start out with high-quality materials. \u201cAvoid paper that\u2019s too thin, as it\u2019s going to tear easily and just be frustrating,\u201d explains vanGerwen. \u201cPapers from dollar stores, for example, tend to rip, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to spend a lot.\u201d\n\nSome of her go-to places for quality wrapping materials include The Paper Place, Minted, and Paper Source. Personally, I\u2019ve had great luck with wrapping paper from Target and The Container Store, too.\n\n5 Tips to Better Wrapping\n\nOnce you\u2019re armed with your wrapping paper, scissors and tape, it\u2019s time to get to work. Here are vanGerwen\u2019s top tips for an Insta-worthy present:\n\n1. Measure Your Paper\n\nThere\u2019s such a thing as too much wrapping paper\u2014and too little. \u201cPaper should be large enough to wrap around the box with a little bit of overlap, plus enough overhang on either side to cover the ends of the box,\u201d explains vanGerwen. \u201cToo much paper gets in the way and you end up with wrinkles and bulges; too little paper and, well, you can\u2019t cover your box.\u201d\n\n2. Wrap It Tight!\n\nFor best results, make sure your wrapping paper is tight around the package. \u201cIt should be snug and lie flat to avoid unsightly creases, gaps and bubbles.\u201d Personally, I find it helpful to tape the inner edge of the paper to the package so you can pull it taut as you wrap the paper around.\n\n3. Fold Exposed Edges\n\nThis next tip is ingenious, so easy and effective: \"Fold over exposed edges of paper, both along the seam at the back and at either end,\" says vanGerwen. \"This hides crooked cuts for a cleaner look.\"\n\n4. Keep It Crisp\n\nJust like your French fries, the edges of your packages should be crisp. Our gift stylist recommends using your fingernail to create sharp, defined creases.\n\n5. Hide the Tape\n\nIf you want to get really extra about your wrapping, you\u2019re going to need some double-sided tape in your arsenal. This allows you to hide it inside, resulting in a super neat appearance. However, depending on what paper you use, double-sided tape might not stick well: \u201cNote that double-sided tape won\u2019t stick to some papers,\u201d says vanGerwen, \u201cin which case you should test both clear tape as well as invisible tape to find which one shows less.\u201d\n\nLittle Embellishments Go a Long Way\n\nOnce your package is wrapped, it\u2019s time to decorate. You can go with a traditional bow or combine it with another little decoration for an added touch of holiday spirit. \u201cI like to add embellishments like bells, tree ornaments, and sprigs of greenery to make gifts festive,\u201d says vanGerwen. Not great with ribbon? She also recommends using pretty washi tape to give your package a little extra pizazz\u2014no bow needed.\n\nWrapping Awkward Shapes (Hint: Gift Bag Time)\n\nOkay, but what about those awkwardly-shaped items that you just don\u2019t know what to do with? \u201cJust put it in a box or gift bag; there\u2019s no need to frustrate yourself by trying to get paper around a weird shape.\u201d\n\nGift bags can be an easy way out, but at the end of the day, sometimes they\u2019re necessary\u2014especially if you\u2019re pressed for time. \u201cDon't avoid gift bags because you think it\u2019s lazy,\u201d she says. \u201cWrapping should be fun, not frustrating.\u201d With that holiday motto in mind, it\u2019s time to create some beautiful presents!\n\nWhat are your best tips for a well-wrapped present?
