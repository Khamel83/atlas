Follow The Points Guy on Facebook and Twitter, and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @tpg_alerts.\n\nAirfare deals are typically only available on limited dates. We recommend you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency such as Orbitz or\u00a0Expedia, which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you\u2019re using\u00a0The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express, you\u2019ll need to book directly with the airline or through the Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points. Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia\u2019s courtesy cancellation if you\u2019re unable to get the time away from work or family.\n\nNow\u2019s a great time to plan your fall (technically spring) getaway\u00a0to\u00a0the South Pacific. Qantas and Virgin Australia are currently offering flights from Los Angeles (LAX) to major cities in Australia and New Zealand, such as Auckland (AKL), Brisbane (BNE) and Sydney (SYD), from $707 round-trip. The low fares are available for travel from\u00a0August through December 2018 so you\u2019ll get to enjoy comfortable temperatures and avoid larger summer crowds.\n\nYou don\u2019t need any\u00a0tricks to get these prices, just\u00a0head to\u00a0Google Flights\u00a0and plug in your desired departure city. After finding dates that work best for you, book with the airline directly or with an OTA such as Expedia or\u00a0Priceline.\u00a0As a reminder, if you\u2019re an Amex cardholder, you may be eligible for discounts on Qantas flights by booking through\u00a0The Travel Collection.\n\nAirlines: Qantas, Virgin Australia\nRoutes: LAX to AKL/BNE/CHC/MEL/SYD\nCost: $707+ round-trip in economy\nDates:\u00a0August \u2013 December 2018\nBooking Link:\u00a0Orbitz,\u00a0Expedia\u00a0or directly with the airlinePay With: The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express (5x on airfare), Chase Sapphire Reserve, Premier Rewards Gold Card from American Express, Citi Prestige (3x on airfare plus excellent trip delay insurance) or Chase Sapphire Preferred (2x on travel)\n\nHere are a few examples of what you can book:\n\nLos Angeles (LAX) to Auckland (AKL) in September for $707 round-trip on\u00a0Qantas via Expedia:\n\nLos Angeles (LAX) to Auckland (AKL) in December for $707 round-trip on\u00a0Qantas via Expedia:\n\nLos Angeles (LAX) to Melbourne (MEL) in December for $741 round-trip on\u00a0Qantas\u00a0via Expedia:\n\nLos Angeles (LAX) to Sydney (SYD) in November for $753 round-trip on\u00a0Virgin Australia via Expedia:\n\nLos Angeles (LAX) to Brisbane (BNE) in December for $758 round-trip on\u00a0Virgin Australia via Expedia:\n\nMaximize Your Purchase\n\nDon\u2019t forget to use a credit card that earns additional points on airfare purchases, such as\u00a0The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express (5x on flights booked directly with airlines or American Express Travel), Chase Sapphire Reserve, American Express Premier Rewards Gold or Citi Prestige (3x on airfare) or the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card (2x on all travel purchases).
