      "Selection": "The WikiLeaks cables, in other words, read more compellingly as a kind of literature. True, they don\u2019t exactly evoke Tolstoy, Graham Greene, or even John le Carr\u00e9. But diplomats are trained to chronicle the same tics and quirks of character that masters of fiction carefully record\u2014and often with the same aim, of penetrating the surface equanimity of the characters they depict in order to win through to some more essential truths about their motivations. There\u2019s a reason, after all, that the fictional world, like the diplomatic one, is governed by plots\u2014and that both fields share a comfort with moral ambiguity and casual deception that you don\u2019t find in most other endeavors.
