      "Selection": "Lanee Jackson of Black Lives Matter DC participates in an \u201cEssential, Not Expendable\u201d demonstration in Washington, DC, on April 27. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nBlack Americans have lost 45,777 years of life before age 65 due to Covid-19. White Americans have lost 33,446 years.\n\nMore than 120,000 people in the United States have died of Covid-19.\n\nIt\u2019s an enormous number and, quite frankly, a failure of our national response, and of our leadership. But that number does not seem to be enough to inspire more politicians in states to action, to inspire all Americans to wear masks, to inspire self-sacrifice to save lives.\n\nAnd so we are at a dangerous time in the pandemic. Cases are rising in many states, along with hospitalizations. Deaths have not started rising nationally yet, but researchers fear they\u2019re coming: It can take, on average, 17.8 days from the start of symptoms to a Covid-19 death. America needs a wake-up call to this endless disaster, and fast.\n\nThe death count is almost certainly an undercount. It doesn\u2019t even begin to tell the whole story. Recently, Harvard epidemiologists calculated a Covid-19 statistic that lands like a gut punch. The statistic is \u201cyears of potential life lost.\u201d And perhaps it can help shake our collective numbness to the pandemic.\n\nPsychology teaches us it\u2019s too easy to grow numb to mass suffering and death. We need to fight against that instinct when we can. A life lost isn\u2019t just a single number; it\u2019s a trauma with a ripple effect, throughout our communities, and throughout time.\n\nImagining more than 138,000 years of human life lost\n\nCalculating years of potential life lost is somewhat straightforward. The Harvard team looked at death certificate data from people who died of Covid-19 and set a cutoff age, in this case 65.\n\nThey then found all the people who died of documented Covid-19 before reaching this age, and summed up how many years they had left until age 65. This analysis made 65 the cutoff age to try to give a sense of the burden of younger people dying of Covid-19 (though they aren\u2019t dying in rates as high as older people, their loss is still immense). \u201cThere\u2019s an arbitrariness,\u201d to the cutoff, Nancy Krieger, a Harvard epidemiologist who co-authored the analysis, says. \u201cBut 65 is not arbitrary from a policy standpoint, in terms of benefits, in terms of Social Security, in terms of Medicare. It\u2019s an age that helps also distinguish between people who are of working age still versus not.\u201d\n\nBlack Americans under the age of 65 have lost, collectively, 45,777 years of life, the researchers\u2019 analysis (published in a working paper) found. Hispanics and Latinos lost 48,204.\n\nWhite Americans under age 65 have lost, collectively, 33,446 years of life. Already you can see a clear disparity. White people in the United States greatly outnumber Black people and Hispanics \u2014 there are also more deaths among white people overall \u2014 but the burden of years life lost among this young group is in these minority communities. (American Indians and Alaska natives lost 1,745 years of life. Asian and Pacific Islanders lost 8,905.)\n\nTallied up, that totals more than 138,000 years of human life lost before age 65. That\u2019s enormous \u2014 and still an undercount. Many of these people would have lived to a much older age. Still, this small slice of our national loss is enormous: What is 138,000 years of human life worth?\n\n\u201cYou think about people being the dynamic beings that we are, living across space and time,\u201d Krieger says. \u201cAnd then you have lives that are just pulled out of the picture.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a huge loss.\n\n\u201cThink of all people do in a year,\u201d Rhea Boyd, a pediatrician and public health expert, tweeted on Twitter, referencing Krieger\u2019s study. \u201cYou work, have babies, get married, make memories. Black and Latinx populations have lost those opportunities more than 45,000 times from COVID alone.\u201d\n\nThink of all people do in a year. You work, have babies, get married, make memories.\n\nBlack and Latinx populations have lost those opportunities more than 45,000 times from COVID alone.\n\nThis racial health inequity has cost Black and Latinx folks an enormous amount.\n\n\u2014 Rhea Boyd MD, MPH (@RheaBoydMD) June 16, 2020\n\nAmerica may be growing numb to the pandemic \u2014 but it\u2019s never been more critical to act\n\nThere\u2019s a growing sense that America is giving up on the pandemic. Many states have lifted stay-at-home orders without aggressive new mitigation measures in place. And as cases rise in certain states, it\u2019s unclear if governments will take further action to stop the exponential growth.\n\nAs a reporter covering the pandemic, I feel a greater sense of pandemic doom now than in February. In February, we didn\u2019t know what was going to happen, but we were prepared to do something. Now we have a better idea of what will happen, and we\u2019re largely giving up.\n\nIt\u2019s partly understandable. People are tired of stay-at-home orders. People need to work (especially if the government is unwilling to provide expanded support). There\u2019s also been an absence of a strong, nationalized message on the pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a lot of information for individuals navigating the Covid-19 world, but it gets undermined by the Trump administration, which seems to try to make the issue of mask-wearing into more of a front in the culture wars than a guideline for public health.\n\nBut it\u2019s also understandable in terms of human psychology. There\u2019s a concept called psychic numbing, and it may, in part, explain the apathy and exhaustion many are feeling about the coronavirus pandemic. It means that as the number of victims in a tragedy increases, our empathy, our willingness to help, reliably decreases. This happens even when the number of victims increases from one to two.\n\n\u201cAnything that happens on a large scale seems to require that we use numbers to describe it, and yet numbers are precisely the mode of discourse that, in most cases, leaves audiences numb and messages devoid of meaning,\u201d Paul Slovic, the University of Oregon psychologist who has studied psychic numbing for years, writes.\n\n\u201cYears of life lost\u201d could help cut through the numbing\n\nFor me, the \u201cyears of life lost\u201d metric helps cut through the numbing by making these deaths a little less abstract. Think about one year of your life: of the depth and richness of it, of what you can accomplish in it, of how many people you can show your love to during it. Now try to multiply that by 138,000.\n\nThis also runs the risk of becoming another large number. But perhaps its novelty, and its accessibility in terms of applying it to our own lives (we can all imagine a year of life), can help. It also underscores how a single death is a trauma that can ripple out.\n\n\u201cWhen someone dies, their own death matters enormously,\u201d Krieger says. \u201cBut it matters enormously for everyone in that person\u2019s family, friends, and networks. When you strip out someone at a much younger age, there\u2019s just a different dimension to what that burden is.\u201d\n\nNo death occurs in a vacuum. \u201cIt\u2019s also all the ripple effects,\u201d Krieger says. The parents who can no longer provide for their kids. The people who can no longer contribute to their communities. \u201cThis gives a different view, and I think it\u2019s a very important one about who is being ripped out of society at younger ages.\u201d\n\nA life lost isn\u2019t just a single number \u2014 it\u2019s a trauma with a ripple effect, throughout our communities, and throughout time\n\nEven among older people, years of life \u2014 years of potential \u2014 are being lost. In Italy, researchers found that Covid-19 was killing people around 12 to 14 years before they might have died naturally. Even accounting for age and underlying conditions, the study found, people were dying more than five years sooner than life span estimates would suggest.\n\nOf course, death isn\u2019t the only effect Covid-19 has had on our society. There are plenty of other reasons we need greater action to manage the pandemic. One is the great health burden \u2014 all the hospitalizations, the days sick, the lingering effects \u2014 on those who fall ill but recover. Also the unknowns: Even asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 may leave a mark on the lungs.\n\nAnother reason is to save our economy. Another is for our mental health. Nationally, around a third of Americans have reported symptoms of anxiety and depression since late April. For comparison, in the first three months of 2019, just 11 percent of Americans reported these symptoms on a similar survey.\n\nDeath \u201cis really important,\u201d Krieger says. \u201cBut there\u2019s also when somebody gets sick, or they\u2019re worried about being sick, there\u2019s all the fear that goes with that. There\u2019s the concerns of their loved ones about them. There\u2019s the questions of what the economic implications are for individuals and their households if someone becomes ill.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the unfair burden Covid-19 is placing on Black and minority communities \u2014 in terms of health and mortality, but economically too. In the paper, Krieger and her co-authors find Covid-19 mortality is nine times higher in Black communities compared to white people in the 35- to 44-year-old range. \u201cYou don\u2019t get relative risks for seven- to ninefold for most things in the US for health inequities,\u201d Krieger says. This is extreme.\n\nAnd a lot more damage can still be done. For the pandemic to simmer down naturally \u2014 in a way that will allow life to go back to normal \u2014 the population needs to achieve something called herd immunity. For the coronavirus, herd immunity could possibly be achieved when 50 percent of the population is immune. But it could need to be as high as 65 percent.\n\nNo area is anywhere near that figure, even New York City, where at least 17,000 people have died of Covid-19. In late April, it was estimated that 20 percent of the city had been exposed to the coronavirus. Elsewhere, the infection rates are much, much lower.\n\nThere are so many reasons to not be numb to the coronavirus pandemic. As we see case counts rising, we can\u2019t stay complacent. There\u2019s so much more left to lose.\n\nSupport Vox\u2019s explanatory journalism\n\nEvery day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.
