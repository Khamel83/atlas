      "Selection": "Welcome to Camp52, where we're recapturing the fun of summer as a kid. All month long, you'll find playful, carefree ideas for snacks (s'mores and popsicles, anyone?), drinks, crafts, games, field trips, packing tips, and more.\n\nIn our oh-so busy digital world, I\u2019ve found that one of the most relaxing things you can do on vacation is truly disconnect. And what better way to get off the grid than heading out into the woods for a summer camping excursion?\n\nPersonally, I love camping (even if I don\u2019t do it as much as I\u2019d like!). There\u2019s something so calming about sleeping under the stars and relaxing in nature\u2014without Wi-Fi or video games to distract you.\n \nHowever, if you\u2019re planning your first-ever camping trip, you might not know what gear to buy and bring with you. Luckily, there are thousands of avid outdoorspeople who are more than happy to share their thoughts on popular equipment. To that end, here\u2019s a list of some of the most highly rated camping gear that\u2019s sure to make your trip a success.\n \nFirst up, you need high-quality sleeping equipment if you\u2019re going to be rested and ready for adventure.\n\nReviews: 7,000+Rating: 4.4 stars\n \nIt\u2019s easy to see why this Coleman tent is so popular. It comes in a variety of sizes, sleeping anywhere from two to six people, and even the larger sizes are still incredibly affordable at under $100. It takes just a few minutes to set up, and its rainfly and welded floors will keep you dry, even if the weather outside is soggy.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 600+Rating: 4.4 stars\n \nIf you need a more spacious sleeping space, this tent from CORE can accommodate up to nine people or two queen-size inflatable mattresses. It includes a room divider, as well as in-wall storage pockets, and the pre-assembled frame makes it incredibly fast and easy to construct. It\u2019s the perfect option if you\u2019re camping with the whole family!\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 2,000+Rating: 4.3 stars\n \nDon\u2019t feel like carrying an air mattress out into the wilderness? Just bring one of these inflatable sleeping pads instead. They weigh just 16 ounces, so they won\u2019t drag you down, and they\u2019re quick to inflate, unlike full-size mattresses. Plus, they have thousands of glowing reviews\u2014what more could you ask for?\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 4,000+Rating: 4.3 stars\n \nColeman is one of the go-to camping brands for frequent adventurers, so it should come as no surprise that they\u2019ve pretty much perfected the sleeping bag. This affordable single-person sleeping bag is ideal for snoozing in 40- to 60-degree conditions, as the plush interior will keep you cozy all night long.\n\nPhoto by Coleman \n\nReviews: 3,500+Rating: 4.8 stars\n \nWant to cuddle up with your loved ones under the stars? This queen-size sleeping bag has more than enough room for two people, and it comes with two travel pillows, too. Reviewers say it's lightweight, cozy, and water-resistant, calling it a must-have for camping couples.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 2,000+Rating: 4.1 stars\n \nRegular pillows are fairly bulky, and they\u2019ll take up quite a bit of space in your car as you pack to go camping. Instead, get a couple of these compressible travel pillows, which roll up into a compact form, allowing you to save space in your bag. They come in a variety of sizes, as well as several adorable patterns.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nWhen You're Trying to Thrive in the Wilderness\n\nDon\u2019t just get by on your camping trip\u2014live your best life! You\u2019ll need these essential tools to avoid bug bites, roast lots of marshmallows, and stay comfy in the woods.\n \nReviews: 1,200+Rating: 4.3 stars\n \nBug spray is an absolute must when you\u2019re camping, as there are sure to be mosquitoes and other biting critters around. Folks swear by this particular bug spray from Repel, which contains 40 percent DEET\u2014the highest concentration available in a spray container. It provides up to eight hours of protection against mosquitoes, ticks, gnats, biting flies, and more, and reviewers say it\u2019s not sticky or too smelly.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 4,500+Rating: 4.3 stars\n \nChances are you\u2019re not wearing bug spray to bed, so unless you want to wake up covered in itchy bug bites, be sure to pack some permethrin spray for your gear. When applied to fabrics (such as your clothing, tent, and sleeping bag), this chemical will keep bugs like ticks and mosquitos away. The best part? It lasts for up to six washes or 40 days, so you won\u2019t have to reapply constantly.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 2,000+Rating: 4.7 stars\n \nOnce the sun sets on your camp, you\u2019ll need a few lanterns to illuminate your surroundings, and there\u2019s no better option than this one from Streamlight. These lanterns come in a variety of strengths, ranging from 200 to 1,100 lumens, and they have rings on both the top and bottom for hanging them up. Plus, if you want to light up a larger area, just pop off the top of the lantern and let it shine.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 4,000+Rating: 4.0 stars\n \nIs your pack feeling a little heavy already? Don\u2019t worry\u2014this handy fire starter won\u2019t weigh you down. The pocket-sized magnesium fuel bar comes with a striker, as well as a compass, all of which you can store on the convenient ball chain. Plus, it will work in wet conditions, ensuring you\u2019re never left out in the cold.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nWhen You're Whipping Up a Woodsy Meal\n\nJust because you\u2019re roughing it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t cook delicious meals. With a stove, some cookware, and a can-do attitude, you\u2019ll be able to eat like royalty.\n \nReviews: 2,000Rating: 4.5 stars\n \nAll you need to cook your favorite dishes is this two-burner propane stove, which folds up into a super-convenient form for transport. It has pressure-control technology to help provide consistent heat, and it even has wind-blocking side panels so your flame doesn\u2019t go out. It\u2019s basically a gas stovetop to use in the great outdoors!\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 3,000+Rating: 4.6 stars\n \nYou probably don\u2019t want to bring your nice pots and pans out into the woods, so invest in this affordable camping mess kit, which includes an anodized aluminum pot, pan, and lid, as well as a number of cooking utensils. The cookware is lightweight and packs up into an easy-to-store bag, allowing you to cook deluxe dinners just about anywhere.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 1,500Rating: 4.2 stars\n \nThere are no fridges in the woods, so you\u2019ll need to bring along a cooler to keep your drinks and food fresh\u2014as well as a lot of ice! This zipperless hardbody cooler comes in several sizes, so you can choose the one that fits your needs, and it even includes a removable shelf to help you keep your grub organized.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nWhen You're Kicking Back and Relaxing\n\nWith the sleeping, eating, and bug spraying on lock, don\u2019t forget to pack a few accessories to help you relax and unwind during your trip. It's the best part of the camping experience!\n \nReviews: 3,500+Rating: 4.8 stars\n \nWhat\u2019s more serene than hanging out in a hammock and reading a good book? You can make this a reality, no matter where you\u2019re camping, thanks to this portable hammock. It\u2019s made from heavy-duty parachute-grade nylon, and you can set it up anywhere with the included tree straps and carabiners. Reviewers call this product fantastic, especially for such an affordable price.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 5,500+Rating: 4.4 stars\n \nKeep your relaxation essentials close by with this camping chair, which has a built-in cooler pocket on one side and a mesh storage compartment on the other. The chair also has a fully cushioned seat and supportive back, making it the perfect tool to hang out and take in the scenery.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\nReviews: 2,500Rating: 4.3 stars\n \nKayaking is incredibly fun\u2014but kayaks themselves are bulky and hard to transport. That\u2019s what makes these inflatable kayaks such an amazing innovation! This particular model is ideal for lakes and mild rivers, and reviewers say it\u2019s incredibly fun to use and easy to transport. Win-win.\n\nPhoto by Amazon \n\n This post contains products that are independently selected by our editors and writers, and Food52 may earn an affiliate commission. \n\nNow, for camping snacks...\n\n What's your favorite camping gear out there?
