I think the most important part of being healthy and in great shape depends on what and when you eat. Being diabetic most of my life, I have always had to take food very seriously. Today I encourage you to say yes to the keto diet, give it a try... pic.twitter.com/9Fa1NeVVPo\n\u2014 Halle Berry (@halleberry) January 26, 2018\n\nThe diet\u2019s long history in science also lends it credibility. Doctors have been prescribing ketogenic diets to treat epilepsy for nearly a century, and increasingly believe it may hold promise for people with Type 2 diabetes. \n\nBut what\u2019s lost in the many trend articles and books about \u201cgoing keto\u201d for weight loss today is that this diet is the same one the now-late Dr. Robert Atkins and other low-carb evangelists have been selling since the 1960\u2019s. (Diet peddlers have an incredible knack for rebranding old ideas \u2014 over and over \u2014 and in our eternal confusion about what to eat, we keep falling for it all.) \n\nThose older keto diets didn\u2019t work for most people hoping to slim down, and there\u2019s no evidence the newly popular keto diet will be any different. Here\u2019s why. \n\nHow the ketogenic diet works  \n\nTo understand the ketogenic diet, you need a quick primer on how the the human body gets energy. We are fueled primarily by glucose, or blood sugar, much of which we derive from carbohydrates in foods like bread, fruit, potatoes, and sweets. \n\nIf glucose levels in the blood drop to really low levels, we\u2019d pass out and die. But, interestingly, the body can\u2019t store much glucose \u2014 only enough to last a couple of days. So if we forgo eating carbs for a few days, we need other ways to keep going. One of those is a process called ketogenesis. \n\nIn ketogenesis, our livers start to break down fat into a usable energy source called ketone bodies, or ketones for short. \u201cOrgans like the brain that normally rely primarily on glucose for fuel can begin to use a substantial amount of ketones,\u201d said Kevin Hall, a National Institutes of Health senior investigator who has studied the ketogenic diet extensively. So ketones can stand in for glucose as fuel for the body when there\u2019s a glucose shortage. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing physiological adaption to starvation that allows tissues like the brain to survive,\u201d Hall added.  \n\nOnce ketogenesis kicks in and ketone levels are elevated, the body is in a state called \u201cketosis.\u201d There are a few ways to get into ketosis. One is through fasting: When you stop eating altogether for an extended period of time, the body will ramp up fat burning for fuel and decrease its use of glucose (which is part of the reason people can survive for as long as 73 days without food).  \n\n        Going keto means subsisting mainly on meats, eggs, cheese, fish, nuts, butter, oils, and vegetables \u2014 and avoiding sugar, bread and other grains, beans, and even fruit.\n\n        Elena Shashkina/Shutterstock\n\nAnother way to get into ketosis is by eating less than 20 to 50 grams of carbs \u2014 or a slice or two of bread \u2014 per day. So people on ketogenic diets get 5 percent of their calories from carbohydrates, about 15 percent from protein, and 80 percent from fat. Note that that\u2019s a much lower ratio of protein and more fat than you\u2019d get on other low-carb diets, but it\u2019s this ratio that will force the body to derive much of its energy from ketones.\n\nIn practice, that means subsisting mainly on meats, eggs, cheese, fish, nuts, butter, oils, and vegetables \u2014 and carefully avoiding sugar, bread and other grains, beans, and even fruit. Again, if this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because it\u2019s not that different from the Atkins diet, among the most famous very low-carb diets that promise to get your body burning fat. (Atkins promised to help people \u201cstay thin forever,\u201d the same way the now popular Keto Reset Diet book promises to \u201cburn fat forever.\u201d)\n\nWhile the evidence behind ketogenic diets for diabetes is still preliminary and the evidence for weight loss isn\u2019t all that convincing (more on that next), the evidence of using the diet to treat epilepsy is extremely robust. The idea of treating people with epilepsy with the keto diet came about in the 1920s, when researchers observed that people who fasted experienced fewer seizures. (Researchers still aren\u2019t sure why the diet can work for epilepsy, but a few mechanisms have been proposed, including making neurons more resilient during seizures.) \n\nToday, studies have shown that children and adults whose epilepsy doesn\u2019t respond to medications seem to experience a pretty large reduction in seizures when following a ketogenic diet. That doesn\u2019t, however, mean that the diet works for other conditions. \n\nThe theory behind very low-carb diets is that they help people burn extra calories and fat \u2014 and lose more weight  \n\nAdvocates of ketogenic diets for weight loss claim that ketogenesis can lead to a \u201cmetabolic advantage\u201d that helps burn 10 times more fat and an extra 400 to 600 calories per day \u2014 the same as a vigorous session of physical activity. The main scientific model that\u2019s used to explain that advantage is the \u201dcarbohydrate-insulin hypothesis,\u201d which has been promoted by experts like Harvard professor David Ludwig, Obesity Code author Jason Fung, and Robert Lustig of the University of California San Francisco, among others.\n\nEating carbs drives up insulin production, the hypothesis suggests, stirring hunger and causing the body to hold on to fat and suppress calorie burn. But when you replace carbs with fat, you subdue hunger, boost calorie burn, and melt away fat. With fewer carbs, your body also doesn\u2019t produce as much insulin \u2014 and that increases the rate of ketogenesis and decreases the body\u2019s need for glucose. \n\nThis might sound great, but what\u2019s often lost in all the boosterism is that this is still just a hypothesis. And most studies of ketogenic and other very low-carb diets suggest they don\u2019t actually outperform other kinds of diets in the long run when it comes to weight loss. \n\nKeto diets don\u2019t seem to help people lose extra weight in the long run\n\nThe keto concept has been catnip for many dieters, perhaps because of the failure of the low-fat experiment of the 1980s and \u201990s to help people lose weight, and the fact that food companies increasingly tell us to be suspicious of carbs and eat more protein. \n\nWhen you look at head-to-head studies comparing low-carb diets to other kinds of diets, weight loss on a very low-carb diet can be a little more dramatic in the short term, but by the one-year mark, all diets perform equally miserably. \n\nThis seminal randomized trial, published in JAMA in 2007, involved 300 women and measured their weight loss on the Atkins diet compared to the Zone, Learn, and Ornish diets. The researchers found that while women on Atkins shed a few more pounds, the weight loss was \u201clikely to be at least as large as for any other dietary pattern.\u201d In other words, Atkins wasn\u2019t substantially better than the other diets. \n\n        JAMA\n\nOther big studies comparing popular diets of different macronutrient compositions, like the one I mentioned above, consistently suggest that the very low-carb approach isn\u2019t a sustainable solution for weight loss. A review of the research on weight loss for different types of diets, published in the Lancet in 2015, found that people on low-carb diets lost 1 kilogram of additional weight after one year compared to people on low-fat diets \u2014 again, a marginal difference. \n\nStill, in the short term, low-carb diets like keto can sometimes help people lose more weight because they cause rapid water loss, which gives people the impression they\u2019ve lost fat. \u201cThis happens because low-carbohydrate diets deplete stored glycogen, and glycogen binds large amounts of water,\u201d explained obesity researcher Stephan Guyenet. \n\nAnother reason very low-carb diets seem to help with weight loss initially is that there\u2019s some evidence they\u2019re effective for appetite control, \u201cso most people actually eat fewer calories than they would on most other diets,\u201d said Guyenet, adding: \u201cThe evidence supporting this isn\u2019t great right now, but that seems to be where it\u2019s going.\u201d \n\nBut again, these benefits seem to disappear in the long run, probably because very low-carb diets \u2014 like many other fad diets \u2014 are hard to stick to. In our food environment, it\u2019s extremely difficult to avoid eating foods like bread, cookies, or pasta for months on end. As Guyenet wrote on his blog: \n\nThe more extreme a diet, the harder it is to adhere to, and the ketogenic diet is extreme. \u201cBut wait\u201d, you say, \u201cI\u2019ve been on the ketogenic diet for five years and it\u2019s easy!\u201d That may be true, but randomized controlled trials don\u2019t lie. The average person can\u2019t even stick with the diet for six months, as judged by urinary ketone levels. The minority of people who find it easy, get good results, and stick with it are the ones who write about it on the Internet.\n\nEven people who adhere to a very low-carb diet in the short term don\u2019t necessarily reap the benefits proponents claim they will \u2014 like the increased calorie burn and fat loss. That\u2019s what the NIH\u2019s Kevin Hall found in another study he designed that\u2019s considered the most rigorous scientific test of ketogenic diets for weight loss. \n\nFor the study, he confined 17 overweight and obese patients for two months to a hospital, where researchers measured their every movement and controlled what they were eating. (Diet researchers called this study the \u201cgold standard\u201d since it was an extremely well-controlled experiment, with all food provided, and it used the best technologies for measuring energy expenditure and body composition.)\n\nIn the first month of the study, participants were put on a baseline diet, which was designed to be similar to what they reported they were eating outside the hospital, including lots of sugary carbohydrates. For the second month, the participants got the same amount of calories and protein as they did in the first month of the study, but ramped up the amount of fat in their food and ate far fewer carbs.\n\n        Javier Zarracina/Vox\n\nThe benefits for the participants following the very low-carb diets weren\u2019t nearly as dramatic as ketogenic proponents claim. While the participants saw their insulin levels drop and stay low, they only saw a small increase in calorie burn, and that waned over time. (That short-lived increase in calorie burn amounted to about 100 extra calories per day \u2014 much less than the 400 to 600 calories promised by low-carb gurus.) \n\nCompared to the baseline diet, the low-carb diet did not cause subjects to experience an increase in fat loss. To be more specific, it took the full 28 days on the low-carb diet for the subjects to lose the same amount of fat as they did in the last 15 days on the baseline (higher-carb) diet that wasn\u2019t even designed to get them to lose weight. So the researchers did not find evidence of big benefits regarding energy expenditure or fat loss after switching to a low-carb diet.\n\n\u201dAccording to the insulin-carbohydrate model, we should have seen an acceleration in the rate of body fat loss when insulin secretion was cut by 50 percent,\u201d Hall told me when the study came out. But he didn\u2019t, which he thinks suggests that the regulation of fat tissue storage in the body has to do with more than just insulin levels and their relationship with the carbs we eat.\n\nThe results of the study were also echoed by a previous paper on the insulin-carbohydrate model, where Hall found that when people cut fat in their diets, they had slightly greater body fat loss than when they cut the same number of calories from carbs. \n\nWhen I recently asked Hall what this research tells us about weight loss with the ketogenic diet, he said simply: \u201cThe idea is that low-carb, ketogenic diets cause your body to burn way more calories, resulting in a lot of weight loss, even if you eat more than you were eating before. But our studies, as well as many others, demonstrate nothing of the sort.\u201d \n\nFor diabetes specifically, keto may be helpful \u2014 but the \u201creversal\u201d claim is overblown\n\nNow that we\u2019ve gotten the weight loss claims out of the way, let\u2019s look at a more promising area of research: using the ketogenic diet as a way to treat or manage Type 2 diabetes.\n\nWith Type 2 diabetes, the body lacks sufficient insulin to move glucose from the blood into the cells for energy. Eating carbs results in an increase in blood glucose \u2014 so if you vastly cut down your carbs, your blood glucose levels won\u2019t go up as much, and you won\u2019t need as much insulin to manage blood sugars. It\u2019s not surprising that researchers have been finding that people who follow a ketogenic diet can better manage their blood sugar by cutting down their carbs. \n\nIn one of the most recent studies on the question, which appeared this month in the journal Diabetes Therapy, 262 adults with Type 2 diabetes patients followed a ketogenic diet, coupled with intensive lifestyle counseling. After a year, their hemoglobin A1C (a measure of blood sugar) dropped below 6.5 percent, the threshold for Type 2 diabetes. Their use of diabetes medications also declined, from 57 percent to 30 percent, and the need for insulin was either reduced or eliminated in 94 percent of the participants who were using insulin when the study began.\n\nThese are impressive results. And other randomized controlled trials on the effects of low-carb diets for Type 2 diabetes have also found improved glycemic control and reduced medication use among patients. \n\nBut the new study was sponsored and run by employees of Virta Health, a company selling lifestyle counseling on ketogenic diets for Type 2 diabetics. Virta, as well as other proponents of keto for diabetes, claims the diet can \u201creverse\u201d diabetes \u2014 and that\u2019s going to a step too far. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s been demonstrated is that [the ketogenic diet] controls blood glucose levels,\u201d explained Guyenet. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing. But to show true remission or reversal, you have to show a person can go back to being able to eat carbs without having diabetes again.\u201d And that has never been proven with the ketogenic diet.  \n\nIndeed, many studies have shown the opposite effect \u2014 that the body\u2019s ability to tolerate carbohydrates can decrease after following a low-carb, high-fat diet.   \n\nAnother common effect of the ketogenic diet is \u201cketo flu\u201d: fatigue, lightheadedness, and dizziness people feel when they greatly reduce their carb intake. This effect should go away after the body adjusts to the diet, but staying on keto for a long time may lead to kidney stones, high cholesterol, constipation, slowed growth (in young people), and bone fractures. \n\nStill, if you have diabetes, it might be worth talking about the ketogenic diet with your doctor. But if you\u2019re going keto to lose weight, buyer beware: In the long run, it looks a lot like other fad diets. \n",
