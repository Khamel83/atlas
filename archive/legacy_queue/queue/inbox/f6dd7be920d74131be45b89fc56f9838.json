      "Selection": "So you came out of the holidays with a fancy new 4K TV? It doesn\u2019t get much better than that. After managing to unbox it and finding the perfect spot in your living room to put it, the next crucial step is downloading the right apps that can showcase that big screen. \n\nThe easiest, fastest way to locate these apps is to open the app store on your TV \u2014 whether it be a Roku TV, Samsung TV, LG, Sony, Vizio, or something else \u2014 and look for a list of the most popular downloads. You\u2019ll likely spot many of the choices that I\u2019ve included below right there. If your TV comes with a voice remote, you can also look for them that way. \n\nNote that not all of these apps will be available on every smart TV. The best way to maximize your content selection is to buy a set-top box such as a Roku Premiere, Fire TV Stick 4K, or Apple TV 4K. (For complete information on how to choose which hardware you need for which apps, check out The Verge Cord Cutter\u2019s Guide: Hardware, Software, and Services.) \n\nI\u2019ve divided the list into several categories: \u201cTV Everywhere\u201d apps, which are associated with traditional cable stations; TV streaming services, which are an alternative to cable; and standalone, specialized apps.\n\nWe\u2019ve rounded up our favorite and most-used apps, games, and utilities. Look for our picks for iPhones, PCs, and Mac; our favorite games for iOS and Android, and our top choices for the PS4, Xbox One, and the Nintendo Switch. \n\nTV Everywhere apps\n\nThese are apps that require a cable account login to get the most from them. If you want to watch full-length episodes, you\u2019ll have to sign in. Most major cable networks have their own app. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing necessarily better about watching your programs via these standalone apps versus just pulling up the on-demand options for these channels on your cable box. But if you prefer to keep things separated or hate your cable interface, they\u2019re a nice option to fall back on. I\u2019ve listed them here along with the services where they\u2019re available.\n\nNote that many of these apps now accept login credentials from DirecTV Now, PlayStation Vue, Sling TV, YouTube TV, and other OTT TV providers such as FuboTV. \n\nA&E Available from Fire TV and Roku\n\nABC Available from Fire TV and Roku\n\nAMC Available from Fire TV and Roku\n\nBBC America Available from Fire TV and Roku\n\nBET Available from Fire TV and Roku\n\nCBS Available from Fire TV and Roku\n\nComedy Central Available from Amazon and Roku\n\nThe CW Available from Amazon and Roku\n\nE!

Prices range from $25 for Sling TV up to over $70 for the most complete channel packages from DirecTV Now and PlayStation Vue. You\u2019ll definitely want to reference our Cord Cutter\u2019s Guide for help in picking the one that offers your favorite channels.\n\nStandalone streaming apps\n\n        Roku\n\nThese are either the streaming versions of specific channels, or offer specialized content. My list includes the obvious essentials such as Netflix and Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, but I\u2019ve added others that aren\u2019t quite as well known. I won\u2019t bother describing the obvious must-haves to you, but I\u2019ve included some comments about some of the lesser-known apps you might want to consider. \n\nCBS All Access\n\nCrackleNetflix stole away Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, but Crackle still has an okay mix of movies to stream. It\u2019s a good Sunday afternoon service. \n\nCrunchyroll\n\nDC Universe\n\nESPN+\n\nGoogle Play TV & Movies\n\nHBO Now\n\nHulu\n\nMLB.TV\n\nMovies Anywhere\n\nNetflix\n\nPrime Video \n\nPandora\n\nPBS\n\nPBS Kids\n\nPlex\n\nThe Roku ChannelDecent choice for random older movies if you\u2019re okay with plenty of ads. \n\nShowtime\n\nShudder\n\nSpotify\n\nStarz\n\nTwitch\n\nUFC\n\nVudu Walmart\u2019s Vudu is probably the best single source for 4K HDR / Dolby Vision movies if you don\u2019t mind paying to rent or purchase them individually. \n\nWWE Network\n\nVox Media has affiliate partnerships.
