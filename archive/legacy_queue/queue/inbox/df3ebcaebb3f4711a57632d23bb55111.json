      "Selection": "In my spare time recently (which isn\u2019t much), I\u2019ve been reading Side Hustle, the new book from my friend Chris Guillebeau. Because CG is a friend, I\u2019m not sure I can provide an objective review of the book, so I\u2019m not going to try. Instead, I\u2019ll give a brief summary and then share some of my own experiences earning money on the side.\n\nSide Hustle Nation\n\nFundamentally, there are only two ways to improve your financial situation: You can earn more or you can spend less. Most money writers focus on the \u201cspend less\u201d side of the equation. That\u2019s great, but there\u2019s only so much you can cut. Eventually, if you really want to pursue your goals with passion, you\u2019re going to have to earn more. \u201cMore income means more options,\u201d Guillebeau writes. \u201cMore options mean more freedom.\u201d\n\nFor many folks, a side hustle is a smart way to earn more. A side hustle, Guillebeau says, is \u201ca moneymaking project you start on the side, usually while still working a day job. In other words, it\u2019s a way to create additional income without taking on the risks of going full throttle into the world of working for yourself.\u201d\n\nThe beauty of side hustles is that they can be started with little or no money. They\u2019re most often passion projects, ways for a person to take something they already love and maybe earn a bit of extra cash.\n\nGuillebeau says there are five core steps to starting a side hustle:\n\nBuild an arsenal of ideas. The first step is to brainstorm a list of ways that you could earn money in your spare time. How could you match your skills and resources to a product or service that people would pay for? List as many as you can think of, then weigh the pros and cons of each.\n\nSelect your best idea. You can\u2019t do everything, of course, so you\u2019re going to have to narrow your list to the single best idea \u2014 the one that excites you the most. \u201cYou\u2019re not making a lifelong decision,\u201d Guillebeau writes. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for the right idea at the right time.\u201d After you\u2019ve picked a project, do some research. Learn how other people have done the same thing. Figure out who your ideal customer is. Decide what it is you\u2019re going to sell.\n\nPrepare for liftoff. After you\u2019ve chosen your product or service, it\u2019s time to prepare for launch. Figure out the core logistics issues. Set a price. Create your workflow. Don\u2019t worry about getting everything perfect, but do take the time to master the basics of your business.\n\nLaunch before you\u2019re ready. This is a lesson I\u2019ve had to learn the hard way. There is always more to be done before you start a big project. (Heck, I wasn\u2019t ready to re-launch Get Rich Slowly last Sunday, but I did so anyhow.) When you have your logistics, workflow, and pricing roughly right, then go. Start your hustle.\n\nRegroup and refine. Naturally, not everything will be perfect \u2014 especially since you launched before you were ready. As you sell, as you interact with customers, learn from your experience. Enhance what is working, and discard what isn\u2019t. If there are things you can\u2019t handle, ask for help. If a process can be automated, automate it. Adjust pricing, if necessary.\n\nBut the most important ingredient to starting a successful side hustle is action. If you don\u2019t take action, nothing else matters.\n\nObviously, there\u2019s much more to the book than that, but those are the core concepts. If you\u2019ve considered making money with a side project, Side Hustle is a book filled with ideas and info that can help you start earning money in your spare time.\n\nIf you\u2019re less into books and more into podcasts, check out Guillebeau\u2019s daily Side Hustle School, which profiles casual entrepreneurs from all walks of life. (You might also enjoy Nick Loper\u2019s Side Hustle Nation.)\n\nLike Father, Like Son\n\nAs I read the Side Hustle, my mind drifted to my own side hustles, and to those of family and friends.\n\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned many times before, my father was a serial entrepreneur. He was always starting businesses. Even when he worked for other people \u2014 selling staples, selling industrial supplies, selling boxes \u2014 he had something brewing on the side.\n\nWhen I was very young, for instance, he decided he wanted to get in on the health food craze of the mid-1970s. In his spare time, he built a wheat grinder. After showing his prototype around, he decided to make and sell them to health food stores around Oregon. This side gig blossomed into an actual business, and within a few years Harvest Mills was also building and selling food dehydrators.\n\nLater, after Dad had sold Harvest Mills and returned to sales, he dabbled in lots of other things.\n\nHe sold World\u2019s Finest Chocolate door to door.\n\nHe tried to write and sell accounting software for Apple II computers.\n\nHe tried to grow and sell nursery stock.\n\nNone of these ventures was particularly successful. But eventually he started Custom Box Service, which still supports our family today.\n\nWith a dad like mine, it\u2019s no wonder that I grew up wanting to run businesses of my own. In grade school, I would repackage my duplicate Star Wars and sports cards to sell to other kids in class. When I finished reading my Hardy Boys books, I\u2019d sell those too. My friends and I drew comics to sell in the school store. (True story: Several years before the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were created, one of my own comics was about a team of super-hero turtles!)\n\nAs an adult, I pursued side projects too. While working at the box factory, I took computer programming classes. Then I got a job (a couple of jobs, actually) programming at a local college. At one time, I was working three jobs totalling 60+ hours per week! I earned some good money with my side hustles \u2014 but I spent it all on stupid stuff. (I hadn\u2019t yet become a money boss, hadn\u2019t discovered how to get rich slowly.)\n\nFrom there, I moved on to computer consulting. I repaired computers for family and friends, and I helped set up their networks. This in turn led to building websites \u2014 including this website, Get Rich Slowly.\n\nThat\u2019s right: Get Rich Slowly started as a side hustle. It was a way for me to earn some extra cash, money I could use to dig out of debt.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing about side hustles. While most never amount to much, some turn into something bigger. Sometimes a passion project turns into something huge.\n\nSide Gigs Aren\u2019t Always Awesome\n\nAs much as this stuff is in my blood, I don\u2019t want to pretend that side hustles always work out. They don\u2019t.\n\nMy computer consulting gig, for instance, never amounted to much. Sure, I made a few thousand dollars from it, but it took tons of time. The money was never worth my while. And of the many businesses my father started in his spare time, only two ever really made money. (Still, two out of ten isn\u2019t bad, right?)\n\nMore recently, my girlfriend Kim tried a side gig that didn\u2019t turn out. While working her day job as a dental hygienist, she set up an online store during her evenings and weekends. She sold teething necklaces. People liked the necklaces, and she sold several hundred, but ultimately she found she wasn\u2019t making money. She was only breaking even. After two years, she decided to pull the plug. (Kim doesn\u2019t regret the experience; it just wasn\u2019t profitable.)\n\nI know other folks who have tried side hustles with varying degrees of success. I have a friend who makes and sells grapeseed oil. I know several people who dabble in rental properties. I know a woman who designs websites in her spare time. I\u2019ve met several folks who write books and/or articles to make extra money. Some folks earn tons from their projects; others only make enough to keep to barely keep the business going.\n\nUltimately, though, I think side hustles are mostly awesome. Even if they don\u2019t bring in big bucks, they give you experience with entrepreneurship. They teach you to be proactive and self-directed. And many times they do help you to supplement your income.\n\nWhat about you? Have you ever pursued a side hustle? How did it turn out? What would you do differently if you had to do it again? Would you recommend that others start their own side gigs? What advice can you offer?\n\nThe post Side Hustles: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly appeared first on Get Rich Slowly.",
