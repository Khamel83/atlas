      "Title": "Photos of science that will change your perspective of the world Quartz",
      "Selection": "Science should not be simply the pursuit of dry facts. Some of the images captured in the course of scientific exploration are beautiful and perspective-changing.\n\nEach year, the biomedical charity Wellcome Trust awards those who create such images. Here is a list of Quartz\u2019s favorite images from the 2017 winners of the Wellcome Image Awards:\n\nHawaiian bobtail squid\n\nNative to the Pacific Ocean, Hawaiian bobtail squid are nocturnal predators that remain buried under the sand during the day and come out to hunt for shrimp near coral reefs at night.\n\nThe Placenta Rainbow\n\nThis image highlights differences in mouse placental development that can result from manipulation of the mother\u2019s immune system. These placentas were investigated at day 12 of the 20-day gestation period\u2014the point at which a mouse\u2019s placenta has gained its characteristic shape but is still developing.\n\nCat skin and blood supply\n\nA polarized light micrograph of a section of cat skin, showing hairs, whiskers and the creature\u2019s blood supply.\n\nSurface of a mouse retina\n\nThis image was created by digitally stitching together over 400 images to form one large image, so as to show the entire surface of a mouse retina.\n\nZebrafish eye and neuromasts\n\nThis four-day-old zebrafish embryo has been modified using two mechanisms\u2014borrowed from the fascinating worlds of bacteria and yeast\u2014that are widely applied in genetics research.\n\nPigeon thermoregulation\n\nThis extensive blood supply just below the skin of a pigeon helps the bird control its body temperature through a process known as thermoregulation.\n\nYou can see the other winning entries in the Wellcome Image Awards here.\n",
