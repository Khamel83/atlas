      "Selection": "Let the luck of the Irish guide your trip to Dublin. Dublin is extremely family-friendly, so it\u2019s no wonder TPG readers have pulled off amazing trips to Ireland\u00a0\u2014 especially if they focus on the most family-friendly international carriers that can get them there using miles (or great sales). And, thankfully, once you\u2019re in Dublin, many of the attractions kids will love charge nothing to access or enter. From the city\u2019s Science Gallery (on one of Europe\u2019s most esteemed college campuses, Trinity College) to the Dublin Zoo (housing animals since 1831), here\u2019s how to soak up the Irish culture in the country\u2019s largest city and major cultural center.\n\nBest Dublin Attractions for Little Kids\n\nFilled\u00a0with green space \u2014 whether landmarks like St. Stephen\u2019s Green or Merrion Square \u2014 Ireland\u2019s capital offers lots of room to roam outdoors. Museums and attractions are, for the most part, kid-friendly, too, and many don\u2019t charge an entrance fee.\n\nDublin Zoo\n\nWith 400 animals and spanning 69 acres of Phoenix Park, 3.7 miles northwest of Merrion Square, Dublin Zoo is known in the zoo community for breeding endangered species, including Rodrigues fruit bats. Admission is free at this historic zoo that has been around since 1831.\n\nWild Lights, Ireland\u2019s award-winning night-time spectacular at the Dublin Zoo.

During the early summer, the rose garden is in bloom, providing amazing photo ops for the family. There are also birds you can visit in a special aviary section of the park.\n\nThe Corkagh Park Rose Garden.

On the west side of the park is a children\u2019s playground and on the east side, a snack stand that also serves beverages. Kids like to experience the park as a self-guided activity, using this guide\u00a0that includes finding, and then drawing, sharing or taking a photo of certain items. One of Ireland\u2019s most famed writers \u2014 Oscar Wilde \u2014 has a trio of statues in his honor that were established in 1997 by sculptor Danny Osborne. There is no cost to enter the park.\n\nA fair in Merrion Square in Dublin.

You\u2019ve likely seen images of these brightly colored doors in photos, but seeing the vividness in person is a treat. And, if you\u2019re craving tea or a snack, the darling House Dublin\u2019s caf\u00e9 (offering both indoor and outdoor seating) is the perfect stop.\u00a0\n\n(Photo by Robert Anasch via Unsplash)\n\nDublin Attractions for Tweens\n\nWith its rich\u00a0history in literature and music, Ireland\u2019s cultural capital is poised to easily reach tweens as a gateway to learning even more about the country\u2019s history.\n\nNatural History Museum\n\nTweens love the \u201cDead Zoo\u201d at the National Museum of Ireland, which refers to the admission-free Natural History Museum. Located on Merrion Street, the museum houses cabinets filled with species that are no longer with us, including skeletons of Irish deer and a 65-foot-long whale skeleton hanging from the roof.\n\n(Photo courtesy of Dublin\u2019s Natural Museum of History)\n\nLiterary Pub Crawl\n\nYou might be thinking that a pub crawl is not a kid-friendly activity, but Dublin is not your average pub scene. In Dublin, everybody goes to the pub \u2014 considered an extension of one\u2019s living room \u2014 and the food menus are hearty. For the literary pub crawl\u00a0(14 euros/$16 each and does not include beer), professional actors take a group to four or five pubs within a few blocks\u2019 radius, starting at The Duke Pub, and re-enact scenes from the writings of famous Irish poets and playwrights, including Samuel Beckett and James Joyce.\n\nNational Botanic Gardens of Ireland\n\nWhile many cities charge an arm and a leg to access its botanical gardens, the National Botanic Gardens\u00a0of Ireland is free. Located a little under 2 miles from the city center, this paradise is easy to reach by public transit via the 4, 9 or 83 buses. Of special interest is a fruit and vegetable garden, filled with Irish apple varietals; and tropical plants typically grown around the world thrive inside The Great Palm House. Kid-specific activities include the Viking House (information about what Vikings grew, wore and ate) and a tropical rainforest (the only one in Ireland) located inside the Great Palm House.\n\nThe National Botanic Gardens of Ireland in Dublin.

This isn\u2019t your typical science museum because the targeted demographic is teens and those in their young 20s. Also, instead of a museum with permanent exhibits, it operates via temporary shows (around 40 to date).\n\nTrinity Science Gallery, Dublin (Photo by Julien Behal/PA Images / Getty Images)\n\nThe National Gallery of Ireland\n\nIf you\u2019re used to plunking down $20\u2013$25 per member of your family to spend a day at the art museum, you\u2019ll love that The National Gallery of Ireland\u00a0(focused on art between the 14th and 20th centuries) is free to enter. It\u2019s conveniently located in the city center, a half-block northwest of Merrion Square. If you can manage to visit on a Sunday, this is Family Day. On Family Day the gallery introduces special kid-friendly tours, activities and sessions (all drop-in, no sign-up required) plus art-creation in the new Maples and Calder Creative Space, launched earlier this year. If your teen is already into art, and wants to explore on his or her own (as opposed to in a group with younger kids), consider checking out a free art pack and audio guide from the information desk.\n\nThe National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin.

It costs just 28 euros ($32) for an entire family (children under 12 are free) to tour the Old Library, which dates back to the 18th\u00a0century, as well as view the Book of Kells, the first four gospels of the New Testament written in Latin around 800 AD. Sign up for a tour here.\n\nThe Long Room at Trinity College (Photo by Aitormmfoto / Getty Images)\n\nRent\u00a0Dublinbikes\n\nIf it\u2019s a nice day and you\u2019re comfortable with the lay of the land, renting bicycles through Dublinbikes (a shared-bicycle company) is a fun activity after you\u2019ve crossed off all of the other must-sees in Dublin on your list. Bike rentals cost 5 euros ($6) for a three-day ticket. To rent a bike, just approach one of the stations in Dublin\u2019s city center (each has about 15 bikes).\n\nDublin bikes along the Liffey River in Dublin.

With world-class museums celebrating the arts and sciences, walkable neighborhoods (you don\u2019t need a car here, nor do you have to travel underground often like you might in Paris or London) and easily accessible cultural icons (from Irish music and dancing to Dublin\u2019s famous colored doors), your kids will definitely remember their trip to Dublin.\n\nTo continue your Dublin trip planning:\n\nUse Points and Miles to Travel to Dublin for St. Patrick\u2019s Day\n\nGuide to Booking Aer Lingus Award Flights\n\nAer Lingus Business Class Review\n\nReview of the Westin Dublin\n\nHow to Spend an Overnight Layover in Dublin\n\nTrip-Spiration: Explore Ireland\n\nFeatured images by David Soanes Photography / Getty Images\n",
