      "Selection": "Etihad is well-known for its posh business and first-class products, but did you know that the airline has a powerful loyalty program too? The airline has partnerships with nearly two-dozen airlines, giving you a ton of options for earning and redeeming Etihad Guest miles during your travels.\n\nSome of these redemptions offer\u00a0incredible\u00a0value too, with some of our favorites being cheap transcontinental first-class tickets on American Airlines and low-cost transcontinental business class tickets with Brussels Airlines and Royal Air Maroc.\n\nPlus, the airline has a number of non-airline partnerships that can help you earn Etihad Guest miles quickly. These various partnerships let you earn miles when staying at hotels, renting cars and making everyday purchases with select American Express, Capital One and Citi credit cards.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at Etihad Guest\u2019s most powerful partnerships. We\u2019ll start by looking at earning and redeeming miles with Etihad\u2019s airline partners, then move onto earning with hotel stays, rental cars and credit cards. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\nFor more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox, sign up for\u00a0our daily newsletter.\n\nIn This Post\n\nEtihad\u2019s airline partners\n\n(Photo by Rebius/Shutterstock)\n\nDespite not being a member of a major airline alliance, Etihad has a broad range of airline partners around the world. These were formed through codeshare agreements and investments, with Etihad owning a portion of airlines like Alitalia and Air Serbia.\n\nAll of Etihad\u2019s partners have a unique earning and redemption chart, with varying rates. For example, American Airlines awards are priced by region, ANA prices by distance flown and Air Serbia prices by city pair.\n\nEtihad doesn\u2019t offer online booking for any of its airline partners, so you\u2019ll have to call Etihad Guest to book these tickets. We highly recommend finding award space before you call. We\u2019ll dive into how to find award space for each partner below.\n\nAir Canada\n\nIn June 2020, Air Canada and Etihad announced a new partnership that allows Etihad members to earn and redeem miles on Air Canada flights, and vice-versa. Air Canada is the largest airline in Canada, serving nearly 200 destinations worldwide. Here\u2019s a look at how you can earn and redeem miles on all of these flights.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Air Canada\n\nEtihad awards up to a 125% bonus on miles flown on Air Canada flights. The earning chart is extensive and has different earning rates intra-Canada and international flights. The international chart includes flights to and from the U.S. as well, so make sure you\u2019re using the right chart to calculate your earnings.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that some Air Canada domestic fares earn 0% miles flown when credited to Etihad. It\u2019s in your best interest to credit intra-Canada flights in the S, T, L, A and K fare classes to programs like Air Canada Aeroplan and United MileagePlus, which do award miles for these fare classes.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Air Canada\n\nEtihad\u2019s Air Canada award chart is distance-based, so you\u2019ll redeem miles based on how far you\u2019re flying. You\u2019ll get the best value when redeeming Etihad miles for short-haul flights on Air Canada.\n\nFor example, you can redeem 5,000 miles for an economy class ticket if the flight is under 500 miles. This includes the 357-mile jaunt from Toronto (YYZ) to New York (LGA) and 324-mile flight from Montreal (YUL) to New York.\n\nBoth of these flights can get expensive when booking at the last minute. I\u2019ve personally paid over $250 for a one-way ticket from New York to Montreal over the holidays. Having this low-cost redemption option is great for those who fly on the route often.\n\nAir New Zealand\n\nAs the flag carrier of New Zealand, Air New Zealand operates routes domestically as well as to Asia, North America, the South Pacific and even Europe. Plus, the airline has a solid business class product and even offers an innovative Skycouch in economy class.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles on Air New Zealand\n\nYou can earn Etihad Guest miles on all Air New Zealand flights. Flights will earn miles based on your booking class, the distance of your flight and the region you\u2019re flying in \u2014 you can find an up-to-date earning chart on the Etihad website. Simply multiply the distance of your flight by the percentage listed next to your booking class to see how many miles you\u2019ll earn on your partner flight.\n\nFor example, if you flew Auckland (AKL) to Los Angeles (LAX) in Air New Zealand C fare business class, you\u2019d earn 9,756 Etihad Guest miles as a non-elite member. The math looks like this: 6,504 miles X 1.5 miles = 9,756. If you have status with Etihad Guest, be sure to factor in elite bonuses, which range from 25-75%.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles on Air New Zealand\n\nYou can redeem Etihad Guest miles on all Air New Zealand flights with open award space \u2014 the easiest way to find this is to use a Star Alliance search tool. Like all Etihad Guest partner awards, you have to call the airline to actually book your award ticket.\n\nEtihad prices Air New Zealand award tickets by distance. To calculate the cost of your ticket, use a website like Great Circle Mapper to find your flight distance and then match it to the appropriate tier on Etihad\u2019s award chart. In the case of AKL to LAX, you\u2019d need a whopping 210,000 miles to book a one-way ticket in business class.\n\nUnfortunately, this makes Etihad Guest one of the most expensive options when it comes to redeeming miles for Air New Zealand flights. You may want to consider other options like Air Canada Aeroplan or ANA Mileage Club if you\u2019re transferring American Express Membership Rewards, Citi ThankYou or Capital One miles for an Air New Zealand flight.\n\nFind Air New Zealand award space with your favorite Star Alliance search engine or on\u00a0ExpertFlyer.\n\nAir Serbia\n\nEtihad owns 49% of Air Serbia, and its funding has helped the Eastern European carrier launch its first long-haul route: Belgrade (BEG) to New York-JFK. Additionally, Air Serbia uses Etihad Guest as its default loyalty program, so you can earn and redeem Etihad Guest miles on all flights operated by Air Serbia.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles on Air Serbia\n\nEtihad Guest has two Air Serbia earning charts: one for short and mid-haul flights and another for its BEG\u2013JFK route. Miles earned are based on class of service and distance flown, so you\u2019ll earn more miles for longer flights. You can view these earnings charts on Etihad\u2019s website.\n\nEtihad Guest\u2019s Air Serbia short- and mid-haul earning chart.\n\nUnfortunately, Economy Light fares \u2014 commonly referred to as \u201cWhite\u201d fares \u2014 aren\u2019t eligible to earn Etihad Guest miles. Thankfully, these fares are only sold on intra-Europe flights, so you will earn at least 25% miles flown in all other fare classes.\n\nEtihad Guest\u2019s Air Serbia long-haul earning chart.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles on Air Serbia\n\nEtihad Guest prices Air Serbia awards route-by-route, so you\u2019ll need to find your route of choice on the Etihad Guest website and match it to the award\u2019s price. In the case of the BEG \u2013 JFK route, you\u2019ll pay 64,082 for a one-way ticket in business class or 44,970 in economy.\n\nMany of Air Serbia\u2019s shorter, intra-Europe routes start at 5,000 miles one-way in economy class, making them a good option if you\u2019re planning a tour around Europe. Just be sure to compare paid fares and make sure you\u2019re getting at least 1.4 cents of value out of each point.\n\nYou can find Air Serbia award space using ExpertFlyer but you must call Etihad Guest to book an award ticket.\n\nAir Europa\n\nAir Europa is the third-largest airline in Spain, with its largest hub being located in Madrid (MAD). The airline serves a number of intra-Europe routes and also flies from Madrid to the U.S. and various destinations in South America, the Caribbean, South America, Central America and the Middle East.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles on Air Europa\n\nYou\u2019ll earn Etihad Guest miles on Air Europa based on the distance of your flight and fare class, but note that a handful of discounted economy fares are not eligible to earn Etihad Guest miles. You can see the latest Air Europa earning chart on Etihad\u2019s website.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles on Air Europa\n\nAir Europa awards are priced based on distance flown, so be sure to check out Etihad Guest\u2019s website for an up-to-date award chart. Prices are reasonable, but not best-in-class. For example, you can fly one-way from JFK to MAD on Air Europa for 71,000 Etihad Guest miles in business class. That\u2019s higher than the 57,500 miles American Airlines charges for Iberia flights to Madrid or the 59,500 miles required by Air Frace/KLM Flying Blue.\n\nFind Air Europa award space using ExpertFlyer\u00a0or a SkyTeam search tool.\n\nAir Seychelles\n\nEtihad Guest is the default loyalty program for Air Seychelles. Etihad owns 40% of the Seychelles-based carrier and has helped the small airline beef up its fleet to include two new A320neo planes. The carrier operates international routes between the Seychelles and South Africa, Israel, India and others.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles on Air Seychelles\n\nLike many of the airlines discussed, Air Seychelles has its own Etihad Guest earning chart. We\u2019ve posted a copy of the airline\u2019s 2020 earnings chart belowand you can view and up-to-date earning chart on Etihad\u2019s website.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles on Air Seychelles\n\nUnfortunately, you can\u2019t redeem your Etihad Guest miles for\u00a0all\u00a0Air Seychelles flights. Only certain destinations are eligible for redemption and each has its own respective award cost. Additionally, the Air Seychelles award chart is pricey \u2014 for example, a flight from Seychelles (SEZ) to Johannesburg (JNB) costs 60,295 miles one-way in business class.\n\nYou can find Air Seychelles award space using ExpertFlyer.\n\nAlitalia\n\n(Photo by Alberto Riva/TPG)\n\nEtihad currently owns 49% of the Italian flag carrier, Alitalia. While this could change when the Italian government nationalizes the airline, you can currently earn and redeem Etihad Guest points on Alitalia flights.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles on Alitalia\n\nYou can earn Etihad Guest miles on all Alitalia flights in accordance to the Alitalia-specific award chart. You\u2019ll earn between 50% and 300% bonus miles depending on your booking class. 300% earning on Alitalia business class tickets is significantly higher than other Alitalia partners.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles on Alitalia\n\nEtihad Guest\u2019s Alitalia award chart lists out a specific price for each of Alitalia\u2019s various routes. As a general rule of thumb, intra-Europe flights are 12,000 miles one-way in economy and 24,000 miles in business class. Meanwhile, flights between the U.S. East Coast and Europe cost 60,000 one-way in economy and 120,000 miles in business class.\n\nThese aren\u2019t particularly great deals, so we recommend booking Alitalia award tickets with a SkyTeam partner like Flying Blue or Delta SkyMiles.\n\nAll Nippon Airways (ANA)\n\nAll Nippon Airways \u2014 commonly referred to as \u201cANA\u201d \u2014 and Etihad have a limited partnership that allows Etihad members to earn and redeem miles on all ANA flights. For reference, ANA is based in Tokyo and flies to most major cities in the U.S., Asia and the South Pacific, and also has extensive service in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles on ANA\n\nAs of April 2019, you\u2019ll earn Etihad miles on all ANA flights in accordance with the airline\u2019s earning chart. This is a huge upgrade to the pre-2019 earning chart which, at the time, only let Etihad Guest members earn miles on select ANA routes.\n\nEarning rates are pretty standard with ANA: you\u2019ll earn 50% to 150% miles flown, with the 150% being reserved for paid first-class tickets. You can also credit your ANA flights to Star Alliance carriers and Virgin Atlantic, so use a tool like Where To Credit to find the best partner to credit your miles.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles on ANA\n\nANA award tickets are based on distance flown, so use GC Mapper to find the length of your flight and compare it to the Etihad Guest ANA award chart. For example, a 6,772-mile flight from New York-JFK to Tokyo-Haneda (HND) would cost 78,000 miles one-way in business class.\n\nThat said, you\u2019d be better off redeeming Aeroplan, ANA Mileage Club or Virgin Atlantic Flying Club miles, which price out awards much cheaper.\n\nYou can find ANA award space using a Star Alliance search engine or\u00a0ExpertFlyer.\n\nAmerican Airlines\n\nYou might be surprised to learn that Etihad has a non-alliance partnership with American Airlines. American miles have long been one of the best ways to book Etihad awards. Likewise, you can score excellent value when booking certain American Airlines award flights with Etihad Guest miles.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with American Airlines\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, you can earn Etihad Guest miles based on your fare class and the distance of your flight. At the time of publishing this article, you can earn between 25% and 250% of miles flown, depending on your fare class.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with American Airlines\n\nEtihad employs a regional award chart for American Airlines redemptions and there are some great deals to be had. Some of the best deals include American Flagship first-class tickets to Europe for 62,500 miles and JFK to San Francisco (SFO) and Los Angeles (LAX) for 32,500 miles in American\u2019s A321T first class.\n\nYou can see the whole American Airlines award chart on Etihad\u2019s website. You\u2019ll often get a far better deal using Etihad Guest miles instead of\u00a0AAdvantage miles, so keep this award chart in mind the next time you need to book an American award ticket.\n\nReady to book? Use a Oneworld search tool or ExpertFlyer\u00a0to look for award space.\n\nAsiana Airlines\n\nAsiana is based in South Korea, with flights to major cities in Asia, Europe and North America. You can earn and redeem Etihad Guest miles on Asiana flights and there are a few good deals to be had if you\u2019re flying from the U.S. to Asia.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Asiana Airlines\n\nYou can earn up to 200% miles flown when crediting Asiana miles to Etihad Guest, but note that many of the airline\u2019s economy fares aren\u2019t eligible for points earning with Etihad. You\u2019ll earn the most points when booking the airlines\u2019 premium first and business class products.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Asiana Airlines\n\nThe Asiana award chart is based on the distance of your award flight. Flights from the U.S. to Asia generally fall into the 6,000-10,000 mile range. This means that a flight from New York-JFK to Seoul (ICN) would cost 88,000 miles in business class. While not the best deal, it\u2019s about the same as using United miles for the same flight.\n\nOne exception to this are flights from the West Coast to Asia. San Francisco, Seattle and Los Angeles to ICN flight are under 6,000 miles in distance, so you can book these routes for just 59,000 Etihad miles in business class and 35,000 miles in economy.\n\nYou can find Asiana award space using a Star Alliance search engine or\u00a0ExpertFlyer.\n\nBangkok Airways\n\nBangkok Airways is a regional carrier based in Thailand. Its route network mostly consists of domestic routes, as well as international destinations like Singapore, Hong Kong and China. This can be a useful partner to have when traveling within Thailand.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Bangkok Airways\n\nThe Bangkok Airways earning chart is pretty simple: you\u2019ll earn 50% to 150% miles flown. Note that many of the airline\u2019s deeply discounted Web Promotion fares are not eligible for mileage earning with Etihad Guest. So be sure to check your fare class before you book.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Bangkok Airways\n\nEtihad\u2019s Bangkok Airways award chart is priced by route and you can see the full award chart on Etihad\u2019s website. Flights start at just 5,000 miles one-way in economy, so these redemptions can be a good option for last-minute or otherwise expensive flights within Thailand.\n\nThere\u2019s no easy way to find Bangkok Airways award space online, so you\u2019ll have to ask an Etihad representative to find the space for you.\n\nBrussels Airlines\n\nBrussels Airlines is a Lufthansa Group airline based in Belgium. While most of the airlines\u2019 routes are intra-Europe, it also offers extensive service to Africa and nonstop flights to New York-JFK, Washington-Dulles (IAD) and Toronto (YYZ).\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Brussels Airlines\n\nYou\u2019ll earn between 25% and 150% miles flown when you credit Brussels Airlines flights to Etihad Guest. See the airline\u2019s earning chart for more details.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Brussels Airlines\n\nLike Bangkok Airways, the Brussels Airways award chart is priced by route. There are plenty of good deals to be had, too \u2014 intra-Europe routes start at just 5,000 miles one-way and a business class ticket from JFK to Brussels (BRU) is only 44,000 miles one-way. The ladder redemption is one of our favorite ways to use Etihad Guest miles as it offers the lowest redemption rate on this route.\n\nYou can find Brussels Airlines award space using a Star Alliance search engine like United.com. Alternatively, you can search with ExpertFlyer.\n\nCzech Airlines\n\nCzech Airlines is the flag carrier of the Czech Republic. While the carrier has downsized over time, it still maintains a solid intra-Europe route network and has long-haul service to Seoul (ICN). The airline has a suite of new aircraft on order too, so we may see the return of North American service with its upcoming A321XLR.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Czech Airlines\n\nYou can earn up to 150% miles flown when crediting Czech Airlines flights to Etihad Guest. Note that you can only credit flights marketed and operated by Czech Airlines to Etihad; flights booked through the airline\u2019s parent company, Smart Wings, are not eligible for earning.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Czech Airlines\n\nThe Czech Airlines award chart\u00a0is priced by route, and one redemption sticks out the most: business class from Prague (PRG) to Seoul (ICN). You can book this route for just 25,610 Etihad miles one-way, which is an excellent option for flying from Europe to Asia. Even better, the route is operated by a Korean Airlines A330.\n\nNote that Czech Airlines is set to return this aircraft to Korean Airlines by October 2020, so this route may be coming to an end. Use ExpertFlyer or your favorite SkyTeam search engine to find award space on this route.\n\nGaruda Indonesia\n\nGaurda Indonesia is the largest airline in Indonesia with hubs in Jakarta (CGK) and four other major cities in Indonesia. Its fleet was recently revitalized with some of its newest planes being the 777-300ER and Airbus A330-300neo.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Garuda Indonesia\n\nYou can earn up to 200% miles flown when you credit Garuda Indonesia flights to Etihad Guest. Unfortunately, the airline\u2019s cheapest economy tickets only earn 25% with Etihad Guest, so make sure to assess all of your crediting options.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Garuda Indonesia\n\nYou can redeem your Etihad Guest miles on all Garuda Indonesia flights. Awards are priced based on flight distance, with the airline\u2019s longest route \u2014 a 7,284-mile jump from London-Heathrow (LHR) to Jakarta (CGK) \u2014 costing a whopping 140,000 miles one-way in business class.\n\nFind Garuda Indonesia award space using a SkyTeam search tool or by using ExpertFlyer.\n\nGOL\n\nGOL is the largest domestic carrier in Brazil, with numerous domestic and international routes. The airline even operates flights to the U.S. from its gateways in Miami (MIA) and Orlando (MCO). While the airline recently partnered with American Airlines for mile redemptions, you can score a better deal with Etihad Guest in many cases.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with GOL\n\nYou\u2019ll earn Etihad miles with GOL based on distance flown. While the earning chart only shows earning for economy class awards, the carrier\u2019s premium economy product (referred to as \u201cMax\u201d) earns 125% to 150% miles flown as it books into the C, D, F or L class.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with GOL\n\nThe GOL award chart is distance-based and offers a good deal on short domestic flights. For example, you can book a one-way ticket from Sao Paulo (GRU) to Rio de Janeiro (GIG) for just 3,000 miles in economy class. This flight can get expensive at the last minute, so it\u2019s a good option to have when planning a tour of Brazil.\n\nYou can find GOL award space on ExpertFlyer.\n\nGulf Air\n\nGulf Air is an international airline based in Bahrain, with connections available to major cities in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Africa. Many of its aircraft are outfitted with a new business class product that TPG Writer JT Genter\u00a0enjoyed on a 2018 flight from London (LHR) to Bahrain (BAH).\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Gulf Air\n\nYou can earn up to 175% miles flown when crediting Gulf Air flights to Etihad. The carrier often has solid deals from Europe to the Middle East, so this can be an interesting way to see another region, experience a new airline and rack up Etihad miles at the same time.\n\nYou can find Gulf Air award space on ExpertFlyer. Unfortunately, the Gulf Air website doesn\u2019t show award availability unless you have enough miles in your account to book the ticket you\u2019re looking for.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Gulf Air\n\nEtihad\u2019s Gulf Air award chart is distance-based. Most Gulf Air routes to Continental Europe fall into the 2,000 to 3,000-tier, so you\u2019ll pay 70,000 Etihad miles for a one-way ticket from Vienna (VIE) or Frankfurt (FRA) to BAH.\n\nHainan Airlines\n\nHainan Airlines is a Chinese carrier offering flights to major cities in Asia, Europe, North America and the South Pacific. The carrier has a relatively new fleet too, with many of its long-haul routes being operated by a mixture of Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 aircraft.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Hainan Airlines\n\nHainan Airlines\u2019 Etihad earning chart awards miles for nearly all booking classes, with first-class tickets earning up to 200% miles flown. Note that Hainan Airlines flights operated by Hong Kong Airlines or another Hainan affiliate are not eligible for earning.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with\u00a0Hainan Airlines\n\nEtihad\u2019s massive Hainan Airlines award chart is distance-based and presents a set of solid deals for short-haul intra-Asia awards. However, we recommend staying away from long-haul awards \u2014 you can get a better deal by booking these with Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan.\n\nYou can find Hainan Airlines award space using ExpertFlyer\u00a0and\u00a0on the Alaska Airlines website.\n\nKorean Airlines\n\nKorean Airlines is the flag carrier of South Korea and is well-known for its great service and excellent first-class product. Etihad and Korean\u2019s long-time partnership not only offers reciprocal mileage earning, but also extends elite status benefits like lounge access, baggage and priority check-in to Etihad elites traveling on Korean Airlines.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Korean Airlines\n\nYou can earn up to 200% miles flown when crediting Korean Airlines flights to Etihad Guest. Note that many premium classes earn more miles when crediting to Delta SkyMiles, so do your research and see which loyalty program is best for you.\n\nYou can find Korean Airlines award space on ExpertFlyer and many SkyTeam search tools, but note that not all flights will be bookable with Etihad miles.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Korean Airlines\n\nThe Korean Airlines award chart is distance-based. Do note, however, that Korean Airlines only opens select award tickets to partner bookings, so it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll be able to book Korean Airlines business class with Etihad miles. Likewise, you cannot redeem Etihad miles for Korean Airlines first class.\n\nMalaysia Airlines\n\nMalaysia Airlines is a Oneworld member and the flag carrier of Malaysia, connecting the country to major destinations around the world. The airline currently serves major destinations in Asia, Europe and the South Pacific.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Malaysia Airlines\n\nYou can earn up to 150% miles flown when crediting Malaysia Airlines flights to Etihad Guest.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Malaysia Airlines\n\nStrangely enough, Etihad prices Malaysia Airlines awards as round-trip tickets. You can, however, book one-way tickets at half the cost of the prices shown above. Like other airlines on this list, the Malaysia Airlines award chart is distance-based.\n\nAdditionally, you\u00a0can\u00a0book stopovers on Malaysia Airlines awards booked with Etihad miles, making these awards particularly useful for multi-stop Asia tours beginning and ending in Malaysia. You can find Malaysia Award space on various Oneworld search engines\u00a0like AA.com.\n\nOman Air\n\n(Photo courtesy of Boeing)\n\nOman Air connects its home airport of Muscat to over 40 destinations in the Middle East, Europe and Asia. It\u2019s known for its hospitality, with its economy, business and first-class cabins all scoring well in recent TPG reviews.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Oman Air\n\nEtihad recently revamped the Oman Air earning chart, raising the earning rates for a number of fare classes. However, the airline\u2019s cheapest fare \u2014 E fare economy \u2014 was downgraded to earning just 10% miles flown.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Oman Air\n\nThe Oman Air award chart\u00a0is priced by destination and its pricing is very\u00a0reasonable. At the time of writing this article, you can use just 39,000 Etihad miles for a one-way business class flight from Frankfurt (FRA) to Muscat (MCT). This route is operated by the airline\u2019s new 787 aircraft, so you\u2019ll enjoy a posh cabin and a solid hard product.\n\nUnfortunately, however, you must book Oman Air awards at least seven days prior to departure, so you can\u2019t use this for last-minute journeys. Additionally, you can\u2019t search for Oman Air award space online, so you\u2019ll have to call Etihad and have the phone representative find award space for you.\n\nRoyal Air Maroc\n\n(Photo by Brendan Dorsey/The Points Guy)\n\nRoyal Air Maroc is Oneworld\u2019s newest member, but its non-alliance partnership with Etihad is here to stay. Redeeming miles for flights from the U.S. to Morocco is an excellent deal too \u2014 a business flight from New York-JFK to Casablanca (CMN) can be booked for less than 50,000 miles.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with Royal Air Maroc\n\nEtihad\u2019s Royal Air Maroc earning chart was revamped in late 2019, but it kept earning rates the same for most of the popular business and economy booking classes. You can earn between 75% and 150% miles flown, with the 150% rate being reserved for business class tickets.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with Royal Air Maroc\n\nNow for the fun part: redeeming Etihad miles on Royal Air Maroc. The airline\u2019s earning chart is distance-based, with flights above 2,001 miles costing just 44,000 miles one-way in business class. This tier includes all three of Royal Air Maroc\u2019s North American gateways: Montreal (YUL), New York-JFK and Washington-Dulles (IAD), making it one of the best ways to cross the Atlantic with points and miles.\n\nIn addition, Etihad recently added the ability to book stopovers on Royal Air Maroc award tickets. Unfortunately, however, you\u2019ll pay per segment when booking a stopover. This means that a ticket from JFK to CMN to Madrid (MAD) would cost 56,000 miles in business class as CMN to MAD clocks in at 539 miles.\n\nThe bad news? You can\u2019t find Royal Air Maroc award space online, so you\u2019ll have to call Etihad and have the phone representative search for you.\n\nScandinavian Airlines (SAS)\n\nScandinavian Airlines \u2014 \u201cSAS\u201d for short \u2014 is the largest airline in Northern Europe. It maintains hubs in major Scandinavian cities like Copenhagen (CPH), Stockholm (ARN) and Oslo (OSL) where it flies to major destinations in Asia, Europe and North America.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with SAS\n\nYou can only earn miles on select SAS routes, all of which are intra-Europe. Thankfully, the earning rates on these routes are high compared to many Star Alliance programs, so it may be worth a look if you find yourself booked on a flight departing Scanianavia.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with SAS\n\nLike earning miles, you can only redeem your Etihad miles on select SAS routes. The redemption rates aren\u2019t particularly intriguing, especially since cash fares on these routes are already cheap. That said, you may want to skip these redemptions and save your miles for a more exciting award ticket.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in booking one of these tickets, use ExpertFlyer or your favorite Star Alliance search engine to find award space.\n\nSriLankan Airlines\n\nFinally, we have SriLankan Airlines. This Oneworld carrier flies from its hub in Colombo (CMB) to major destinations in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. This includes daily flights to the Maldives, giving you an easy way to connect to tropical paradise from elsewhere in the world.\n\nEarning Etihad Guest miles with SriLankan Airlines\n\nSriLankan Airlines doesn\u2019t serve the U.S., so its earning chart won\u2019t\u00a0too helpful unless you\u2019re on a trip in West Asia. Regardless, Etihad offers solid earning rates in most booking classes and offers better earning rates than AAdvantage on business class tickets.\n\nRedeeming Etihad Guest miles with SriLankan Airlines\n\nThe SriLankan Airlines award chart\u00a0is priced by location and pricing is reasonable. For example, you can book LHR to CMB for 76,000 Etihad miles in business class, which is a good deal given the flight is just over 5,400 miles.\n\nFurther, you can book a one-way flight from CMB to Male (MLE) for just 7,000 miles in business class. This is helpful if you find a cheap cash ticket or open award space to Colombo on another airline and want to continue on to the Maldives.\n\nYou can find SriLankan Airlines award space using ExpertFlyer or your favorite Oneworld search engine.\n\nHotel and rental car partners\n\nYou can also earn Etihad Guest points with the airline\u2019s various hotel and rental car partners.
