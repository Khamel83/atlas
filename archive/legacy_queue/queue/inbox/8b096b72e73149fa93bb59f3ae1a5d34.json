Because who wants to sit around in the airport all day anyway?\n\nHave you ever been dreading a flight because of a long connection? These seven airports around the world offer a better way to pass the time \u2014 a free city tour, so you can get a taste of the place you\u2019re passing through. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nIncheon International Airport (ICN) in Seoul, South Korea\n\nThe Korean tourism board offers several free, guided tours of Seoul for passengers with a 5-24-hour layover. Reserve your tour ahead of time online, email transittour@airport.kr or visit the ticket desks on the third floor in front of Gates 25 or 29, or at desks 41 and 42 on the first floor between Gates 8 and 9.\n\nKeep in mind these tours are first come, first serve and you\u2019ll be able to choose between a one-hour, two-hour, three-hour, four-hour or five-hour version depending on how much time you have. Note that you may need to pay $10 for a non-Visa entry permit (depending on which country you\u2019re from) and show travel documents (like your passport, along with arrival and departure boarding passes or e-tickets) when registering for the tour.\n\nSeoul, as seen from the Bukchon Hanok Village rooftops.

More details about each tour option can be found here. Each transit tour has an English-speaking tour guide and is free, however you must pay for meals and admission fees to get into the various attractions it visits. It\u2019s also possible for passengers to do more than one tour if the length of your layover allows it.\n\nNarita International Airport (NRT) in Tokyo, Japan\n\nTokyo\u2019s tour program is slightly different. A volunteer guide will accompany you on public transportation your choice of three different three-hour guided tours:\n\nTour 1: A guided trip to the Narita-san Shinsh\u014d-ji Temple (pictured below), Narita-san Park and Omotesando Street\n\nTour 2: A guided tour of the Museum of Aeronautical Science\n\nTour 3: A guided nature walk through the Japanese countryside\n\nWouldn\u2019t you rather visit Narita-san Shinsh\u014d-ji Temple instead of waiting around the airport? Image courtesy of Shutterstock.\nSelf-guided shopping-themed tours are also available, where you can hop on a shuttle bus and be dropped off at either Shisui Premium Outlets or AEON Mall Narita. Note that you are responsible for any transportation and entrance fee costs that may occur. Visit the Transit Tour Desks at Narita Airport, located in both Terminal 1 and 2, to book your adventure.\n\nIstanbul Atat\u00fcrk Airport (IST) in Turkey\n\nFree city tours of Istanbul are available for international transit passengers flying with Turkish Airlines who have a layover of 6-24 hours. You don\u2019t need to reserve your tour ahead of time \u2014 just head to the Hotel Desk in the International Arrivals Hall (after customs, next to Starbucks) at least 30 minutes before it starts.\n\nThe scheduled tours run everyday from 8:30am to 11:00am, from 9:00am to 3:00pm, from 9:00am to 6:00pm, from 12:00pm to 6:00pm and from 4:00pm to 9:00pm, so check to see which time works best for you.\n\nTurkish Airlines suggests that you be ready for boarding at least one hour before your scheduled departure time, so please allow enough time to go through customs and passport control after the tour so you can get to your flight on time.\n\nEnjoy views of the Blue Mosque in the center of Istanbul on a free tour of the city. Image courtesy of the author.\nA typical Istanbul city tour includes at least the following stops and activities, although these may vary depending on the day and length of the tour you choose:\n\nDeparture from Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk Airport\n\nBreakfast\n\nBlue Mosque\n\nHippodrome: German Fountain\n\nSerpentine Column\n\nObelisk of Theodosius\n\nTopkapi Palace\n\nLunch\n\nReturn to Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk Airport\n\nAdditional stops for the longer tours include a trip to the Grand Covered Bazaar, Eyup Sultan Mosque & Square, the Byzantine City Walls, Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace, the Basilica Cistern, Galata Tower and the Hagia Sophia, among other popular attractions.\n\nIt\u2019s exciting to note that the entire tour, whichever you choose, is completely free and covers all entrance fees and meals. The food consists of Ottoman cuisine \u2014 note that lunch menus offer a vegetarian option, however no other dietary or religious food options are available.\n\nI recently went on this tour, even though it was just a few days following the failed military coup, and had a wonderful time \u2014 stay tuned for a full review of the tour, coming soon to TPG.\n\nDoha International Airport (DOH) in Qatar\n\nThose\u00a0flying on Qatar Airways\u00a0with\u00a0a long layover in Doha\u00a0can participate in a nearly\u00a0three-hour\u00a0free city tour that takes you to\u00a0the Museum of Islamic Art, Katara Cultural Village, the Pearl-Qatar, and the Souq Waqif. You\u2019ll have an English-speaking tour guide and receive\u00a0a free bottle of water.

Each tour only has space for 18 passengers, so head straight there to ensure you\u2019ll get a spot. There won\u2019t be room on the bus for any baggage, so you\u2019ll have to store yours in the baggage center for a small fee before\u00a0boarding the bus.\n\nThe Lungshan Temple of Manka in Taipei, a stop on the free afternoon tour.
