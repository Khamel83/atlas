      "Selection": "It sounds absurd, but Democratic voters might actually be underestimating the significance of the midterm elections.    \n\nBy now, it\u2019s well understood that the outcome will be enormously consequential for the future of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. But these coming elections are not just a battle to control Congress next year \u2014 they\u2019re a battle to control it for the next decade. \n\nWhoever emerges victorious in key November races will have a huge amount of power over the next congressional redistricting \u2014 a crucial event in national politics that comes up only once every ten years. Last time around, Republicans dominated the process and walked away with such slanted district maps that they\u2019ve held the House of Representatives easily ever since.\n\n\u201cThe next decade is essentially on the ballot in the fall of 2018,\u201d David Daley, an author who wrote a book about the last redistricting, told me. \u201cAnd if Democrats don\u2019t win key elections this fall that allow them to have seats at the table in 2021, the party could face another decade in the wilderness.\u201d\n\nThe specific reason this year\u2019s contests matter so much is that hundreds of the politicians who will have a say in redistricting in key states \u2014 mostly governors and state senators in places like Ohio, Michigan, and Florida \u2014 will be elected and locked in to serve four-year terms. That is: they\u2019ll be the people who will redraw the lines in 2021. So the more of these races Democrats win, the better positioned they\u2019ll be to to wipe out the existing, heavily pro-Republican House and state legislature maps in all these states.\n\nFew of these races feature candidates who\u2019ve gained viral fame, and most of them continue to fly under the radar nationally \u2014 but they\u2019ll be incredibly consequential. \u201cSo many people don\u2019t understand that around 800 legislators elected this year will draw the lines,\u201d says Jessica Post of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.\n\nWe\u2019re currently living amidst the consequences of Democrats losing the redistricting game. Republicans dominated these key elections before the 2010 maps were drawn, and they took full advantage of their triumph. Their triumphs in governor\u2019s races and state legislatures across the country allowed them to lock their newfound House of Representatives majority in place, and build in similar advantages in state legislative maps too. \n\nThese maps have made it extremely difficult for Democrats to win majorities ever since \u2014 in the House in 2012, even winning more votes nationwide left the party well in the minority. That could change this year, but only if Democrats win the popular vote not just narrowly but overwhelmingly.\n\nAnd Democrats\u2019 woes are broader than just gerrymandered House maps. Institutional features of the Senate and presidential contests appear to disadvantage them too, posing the risk of an anti-majoritarian political crisis.\n\nReformers held out hope that the Supreme Court would restrict partisan gerrymandering, but justices have so far avoided the issue. So it\u2019s now clear Democrats\u2019 only path toward reversing the GOP\u2019s structural advantage in the House is to win back power in the states, through hundreds of specific races, a large share of which take place this year. \n\nThe good news, in Democrats\u2019 eyes, is that this time around they have a plan \u2014 and, if a blue wave does materialize in November, it would go a long way toward helping them execute it.\n\nDemocrats got crushed in redistricting last time\n\nDemocratic operative Kelly Ward had an up-close view of the last redistricting disaster for her party while it was unfolding, back in early 2010, just two years into Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. (Don\u2019t confuse her with Kelli Ward, the Republican who just lost an Arizona Senate primary.) \n\nWard had just taken a job at the DCCC, the party\u2019s committee for House of Representatives campaigns. She says she was brought in because the situation for the party \u2014 which then controlled the House \u2014 looked so dire that Democrats needed more help.\n\nThe economy was in grim shape, with unemployment near 10 percent, and President Obama and his new health care law were both unpopular. \u201cYou had a lot of incumbents getting very scary polling,\u201d Ward recounts. \u201cSome hadn\u2019t been in trouble in 20 years.\u201d\n\nThis terrible political climate came at the worst possible time \u2014 not only could Democrats lose big in 2010, but the specific contests up that year meant that loss could doom the party in 2011\u2019s redistricting as well. The problem was that while Democrats were struggling to try and hold onto their majorities in Congress, many lower-profile state legislature races were also on the docket around the country \u2014 but getting far less attention and money.\n\n\u201cBy that point, everyone\u2019s house was on fire,\u201d recalls Carolyn Fiddler, who then worked at the DLCC, the party\u2019s state seat campaign committee. \u201cSoliciting resources for this long-term, esoteric thing was incredibly difficult. There was a general lack of awareness on the part of progressives about what these downballot races meant for the next 10 years of policies.\u201d \n\nThe wave turned out to be a tsunami. Democrats lost a staggering 63 House seats, tipping control to Republicans. This dashed Obama\u2019s hopes of passing any more sweeping liberal laws the remaining two years of his first term.\n\nIn state elections, though, the news was even worse. \u201cI call the 2010 election the longest night of my life,\u201d Fiddler, who now works for Daily Kos Elections, says. \u201cKnowing what those results meant for the next decade of American politics was incredibly depressing.\u201d\n\nDemocrats lost six governorships on net, and nearly 700 state legislature seats. But their true disaster was in where those losses were concentrated: in swing states like Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Florida, where the GOP gained total political control. These were the states that mattered most for redistricting \u2014 and Republicans could now redraw maps there while cutting Democrats out of the process entirely.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what they did \u2014 often through secretive and legally dubious methods, as Daley chronicled in his book, Ratf**ked. In Michigan, a GOP staffer enthusiastically emailed about cramming \u201cALL of the Dem garbage\u201d into certain districts. In Ohio, Republicans spent months secretly map-drawing in a hotel room they called the \u201cBunker.\u201d In Florida, the GOP set up a phony public redistricting process for show, and made the real decisions in a \u201cshadow\u201d operation behind the scenes.\n\nAll this paid off spectacularly \u2014 aided by gerrymandered maps (and, some analysts argue, the geography of where each party\u2019s voters happen to live), the GOP has held the House easily ever since, even when they won fewer votes in House races nationwide, as in 2012. This killed any hope of more liberal legislation under President Obama, and allowed President Trump\u2019s tax bill to become law. \n\nThe House even helped make President Trump: Aggressive investigations by the Republican majority helped unearth the email scandal that dogged and perhaps doomed Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. Since then, that same Republican majority has been mostly uninterested in seriously investigating the conflict-of-interest-ridden Trump presidency.\n\nAll in all, Republicans have now controlled the House of Representatives for 20 of the past 24 years. Analysts believe the built-in GOP advantage in the House maps means Democrats need a 6-or 7-point popular vote victory just to narrowly retake the chamber. Simply winning more votes nationwide, as the party did in 2012, doesn\u2019t even get them close. Even beating Republicans by 5 percentage points nationwide could still mean Democrats fall short. \n\nHow to win the game of redistricting\n\n        Kelly Ward, of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, reviews the state level races that helped Republicans dominate the last redistricting process.\n\n        Christina Animashaun/Vox\n\nLeading Democrats are well aware that the party leadership inexcusably dropped the ball on redistricting last time around. So in October 2016, a group of Democratic leaders \u2014 led by former Attorney General Eric Holder \u2014 decided to do something about it. \n\nThey announced the launch of a new group called the National Democratic Redistricting Committee \u2014 acronymed in Washington\u2019s alphabet soup style as the NDRC.\n\nThe new group would be the frontline organization tasked with preparing, coordinating and strategizing for that next redistricting, giving them a five-year head start. \u201cThis unprecedented effort will ensure Democrats have a seat at the table to create fairer maps after 2020,\u201d Holder said at the time.\n\nKelly Ward is now the NDRC\u2019s executive director \u2014 making her, essentially, the person in charge of making sure of repeating last time\u2019s devastating result for the party doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\n\u201cThe 2018 map is a perfect storm in all the right places. The races are in the most important states,\u201d Ward said. When we met several months ago, she laid out Democrats\u2019 plan to avoid to repeating the mistakes of the past.\n\n\u201cWe came in knowing that we needed to develop a comprehensive plan,\u201d she said.\n\nThere are four basic elements.\n\n1. Get the courts to rule that the maps are unfair\n\nThe first prong of the strategy, and one that could produce immediate results, is litigation \u2014 that is, suing over maps the party believed to be rigged against Democrats, to try and get them struck down by judges.\n\nProgressive or reformist groups like the NAACP and League of Women Voters have been filing such lawsuits for many years, often citing racial discrimination. Recently, though, suits have been filed challenging partisan gerrymandering too \u2014 and have resulted in some surprising successes.\n\nFor example, in Pennsylvania this year, the state Supreme Court threw out one of the most blatant partisan gerrymanders in the country on these grounds, and instituted a new map that hugely improved Democrats\u2019 chances to pick up House seats there. And a court recently ruled North Carolina\u2019s map is unconstitutional, too, though the maps may not be redrawn for this year\u2019s elections.\n\nYet the prospects for national litigation darkened considerably in June, with the one-two punch of a Supreme Court punt on a major partisan gerrymandering case, followed by the retirement of the swing vote on the issue, Justice Anthony Kennedy. His replacement, Brett Kavanaugh, will likely join his conservative colleagues in refusing to limit partisan gerrymandering.\n\n2. Reform the process, state by state\n\nThe second plank of the NDRC\u2019s strategy, then, is trying to rewrite the rules for redistricting itself in various states.\n\nIn places where the legislature itself seems too hopelessly gerrymandered for Democrats to have a prayer of taking control before 2021, the NDRC thinks a total overhaul of the process is the best way to improve the party\u2019s odds.\n\nThe group\u2019s preferred reform is to take redistricting out of the partisan legislature\u2019s hands altogether and give the job to an independent commission. A handful of states, like California and Arizona, have already gone this route. \n\nNaturally, though, existing GOP state legislative majorities tend to want to hold on to their control of redistricting. So Democrats and nonpartisan reformers have often tried to go around them by asking for the voters to approve reform, through a statewide referendum. \u201cYou can\u2019t get other types of reform through these legislators,\u201d Ward said.\n\nThere are a few redistricting ballot initiatives up for a vote this November, but by far the most nationally important is Michigan. Both the US House map and state legislature maps there are badly gerrymandered in the GOP\u2019s favor. Now, the proposal going before Michigan\u2019s voters would set up an independent commission of 13 ordinary citizens (four Republicans, four Democrats, and five independents) chosen at random from applicants \u2014 a massive change from a process dominated by politicians.\n\nBut there\u2019s a danger to the commission strategy. Back in 2015, four conservative Supreme Court justices voted to strike down Arizona\u2019s independent redistricting body, saying the US Constitution guaranteed state legislatures must be involved in redistricting (rather than being cut out through a ballot initiative reform). The Court\u2019s five-justice majority upheld the independent redistricting body, but only with the vote of Justice Kennedy, who has since retired. A more conservative majority could conceivably strike down redistricting commissions nationwide.\n\n3. Get the tools needed to do redistricting right\n\nThird in the NDRC\u2019s strategy, Ward says, is the preparation for the nitty-gritty work of the redistricting itself.\n\nBasically, Democrats want their party to have the best mapping software, to do their best to make sure the Census doesn\u2019t go off the rails, and to make sure advocates are informed and active enough to make their voices heard when the maps are being debated. These, Ward says, are the \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d to succeeding in redistricting. This work has begun behind the scenes, but much of it still lies ahead, in hopes of a 2021 payoff.\n\n4. Win the key elections\n\nFinally the fourth part of the NDRC\u2019s plan \u2014 and perhaps most consequential \u2014 is Democrats have to actually win. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at the map through a redistricting lens and being very intentional about where we need to get Democrats elected in order to check Republican power,\u201d Ward said. \n\nSpecifically, these key elections are for the members of the state house, state senate, and (usually) governors in the 37 states where politicians redraw the congressional maps.\n\nAll in all, about 1,500 state senators and 4,400 state House members get to vote on new maps. Thirty-five of these states also elect governors who can veto a map. Broadly speaking, it is these races that are the electoral battlegrounds for redistricting. \n\nBut not all states are created equal. Redistricting is most nationally consequential in states that have two features: they\u2019re populous and they\u2019re politically divided. More populous states are more important for the House balance of power, since they have more representatives. Meanwhile, swing states matter most because it\u2019s possible, with a creative gerrymander, to turn a 50-50 state to one that sends a 75-25 delegation in Congress. \n\nLast year, the Brennan Center released a report assessing just where the GOP\u2019s advantage in House maps was concentrated, and they found it derived mostly from seven states: Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania (before the state supreme court struck down the map), Florida, Ohio, Texas, and Virginia. Some other analysts have added Wisconsin. \n\nJackpot, shutout, or something in between?\n\nStates like these are the crucial ones Democrats need to win \u2014 or at least not get shut out in. And depending on how the various races play out, there are several possible outcomes in each.\n\nThe jackpot: If one party ends up in control of the state House, the state Senate and the governorship at redistricting time, they\u2019ve hit the jackpot. This is called the \u201ctrifecta,\u201d and if a party gets it at the right time, they can draw maps without needing to give their rivals any say. (Another way to effectively hit the jackpot is by just winning a veto-proof majority in both state legislative chambers.)\n\nLast time around, Republicans won oh-so-many jackpots. They came out of the 2010 midterms with trifectas in nearly every big swing state \u2014 Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and (after 2011) Virginia. In North Carolina, the GOP effectively had a jackpot too, since they controlled the legislature, and that state is one of the few that gives its governor no role in redistricting.\n\nThe shutout: Conversely, the worst-case scenario for a party is to be on the opposite end of a trifecta \u2014 winning neither the governorship, state House, or state Senate. \n\nThis is what happened to Democrats in so many key states after the 2010 midterms, letting Republicans gerrymander them to their hearts\u2019 content.\n\nSplit partisan control: Finally, there\u2019s the potential for a partisan split among the three key bodies. The key thing to keep in mind here is that, in most of these states, the new map needs to pass both chambers of the legislature, and be signed by the governor, to become law. You need all three, or else there\u2019s no deal, and the courts impose a map.\n\nSo if a party wins even one of those three \u2014 the governorship, state House, or state Senate \u2014 they\u2019ll avoid the disaster of a shutout, and guarantee themselves a seat at the table (or at least effective veto power) for redistricting.  \n\nThis is particularly important in states where Republicans held the trifecta last time, and wound up aggressively gerrymandering. If Democrats can manage to win even one of the three key bodies in these states this time, they\u2019d be able to force dramatic changes in the existing maps. \n\nThat\u2019s why Virginia\u2019s elections last year were more important than you might think. The state Assembly and state Senate remain in GOP hands, but Democrat Ralph Northam won the governorship. His four-year term means he\u2019ll be in office through 2021, and likely to veto any congressional map that seems skewed against his party \u2014 including the current one, drawn by a Republican trifecta. \u201cThat was the first victory,\u201d says Ward.\n\nWhy 2018 is so important for the 2021 redistricting\n\nThe electoral battle for redistricting dominance isn\u2019t a one-off contest. It\u2019s a multi-year slog of trench warfare that began in Virginia last year, and will spread to many other states this fall, and last for two more years after that.\n\nYet 2018 matters so much because, even though redistricting is still years off, many of the specific people elected this fall will actually draw the lines in the states that matter most.\n\nThese are governors and state senators, who mostly tend to serve four-year terms. Twenty-six governors and nearly 500 state senators with a role in redistricting will be on the ballot in 2018, elected to four-year terms, and \u201clocked in\u201d past 2021. (The rest \u2014 mostly state house members, and the rest of the state senators \u2014 will mostly be on the ballot in 2020.)\n\nThe most important of these lock-in 2018 races are:\n\nThe governorships of Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Texas, and Georgia\n\nThe entire state Senate in Michigan\n\nHalf the state Senates in Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Texas\n\nNeither party will get another bite at the apple for these races before redistricting. \n\nThe governors: Democrats\u2019 best shot\n\nDemocrats\u2019 realistic best-case scenario to get a seat at the table in any GOP-dominated state may be winning just one race: the governorship. \u201cIf Democrats win one statewide race in what looks like it could be a wave year, they can assure themselves at least of veto power\u201d in 2021, Daley says. (After all, the governor\u2019s race is a statewide contest, meaning Democrats don\u2019t have to deal with gerrymandered borders.)\n\nIn Daley\u2019s view, \u201cThe most important elections for Democrats this November would be the governorships of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Florida.\u201d\n\nThese are states that should be swing states, but in which Republicans have gerrymandered state legislature maps too, making it extraordinarily difficult for Democrats to win state House or state Senate majorities. \n\nCurrently, Democrats look competitive in all five of these contests. \n\nThey already hold Pennsylvania, where Gov. Tom Wolf is running for reelection. He\u2019s currently holding a 15-point lead over his opponent, Scott Wagner, in polling averages.\n\nIn Florida\u2019s open seat contest, Andrew Gillum, a progressive who hopes to be the state\u2019s first black governor, is facing off against Trump-backed Ron DeSantis.  \n\nIn Ohio\u2019s open seat contest, former consumer protection bureau director Richard Cordray is Democrats\u2019 nominee. He appears to be in a tight race against former Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine.\n\nFormer state Senate leader Gretchen Whitmer recently clinched the nomination in Michigan, and polls have shown her ahead of GOP nominee Bill Schuette.\n\nFinally, Democrats are at last seeing an opening against Gov. Scott Walker in Wisconsin, whose poll numbers are low as the state\u2019s Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers attempts to finally defeat him. \n\nWinning the governorship in any of these states would guarantee Democrats a seat at the table in redistricting. (You can also arguably add the Georgia and Texas governor\u2019s races to this list, though they are redder states. Stacey Abrams has energized Democrats in Georgia, but in Texas, few give Democratic nominee Lupe Valdez good odds against incumbent Republican Greg Abbott.)\n\nThe next best thing: flipping key state senates\n\nNext in importance are those hundreds of lock-in state senators \u2014 many of whom will be elected in districts that are themselves gerrymandered. \n\nWith so much seeming anti-Trump energy, and many Democrats newly motivated to run for office, the party smells opportunity even in downballot races \u2014  a rare opportunity to overcome a structural disadvantage with the help of a hoped-for blue wave.\n\nThe entire Michigan state senate is on the ballot for four-year terms \u2014 Republicans currently hold a 27-11 advantage there, but most of their caucus is prevented from running again due to term limits, so Democrats are optimistic about making a strong showing.\n\nThe GOP is up 18-15 in Wisconsin\u2019s state senate, 23-16 in Florida\u2019s, 34-16 in Pennsylvania\u2019s, and 24-9 in Ohio\u2019s. Half the seats in each chamber are up in 2018 (with the rest in 2020). Democrats\u2019 chances for an outright takeover look best in Wisconsin and Florida. \n\nMoving to the redder states, Georgia\u2019s entire state legislature has two year terms so there are no lock-in races. But half of the Republican-dominated Texas state senate is up in 2018.\n\nLast but not least: Make other gains in state legislatures \n\nFinally, there are hundreds of other state legislature races that will be on the ballot in 2018, but for two-year terms \u2014 meaning they\u2019ll face election again before redistricting. These aren\u2019t lock-in races, but Democrats are hoping to make as much progress as they can here, so their candidates can gain the benefits of incumbency and send longtime formidable Republican incumbents off into retirement. \n\nFor an example, take the Virginia House of Delegates. All its seats were on the ballot in 2017, and Democrats fell agonizingly short of a takeover, ending with 49 seats to Republicans\u2019 51 (with one tied race determined by drawing a name from a bowl). But all those seats will be up for election again in 2019. And the massive 15-seat gain Democrats already made means a takeover is much closer to their reach next time around, in part because since so many longtime GOP incumbents are already out of the way. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m the most pessimistic one in our office, because I\u2019ve been burned so many times,\u201d Ward says. \u201cWho knows if some of these chambers are possible under the current environment? But we have a few years.\u201d\n\n        Kelly Ward and Jos\u00e9 Morales Jr., community engagement and projects director at the National Democratic Redistricting Committee\n\n        Christina Animashaun/Vox\n\nA crisis of democracy?\n\nBack in 2010, the main Republican group focused on winning the redistricting game \u2014 \u201cREDMAP\u201d \u2014 was perfectly clear about what it wanted: partisan advantage. REDMAP\u2019s website bragged that the party could \u201ccreate 20-25 new Republican Congressional Districts through the redistricting process.\u201d Their goal was to draw lines that would help their party win. \n\nIn one sense, the efforts of the NDRC and Democrats are a similar partisan project. But when you talk to people involved, they express more high-minded motivations. After years of struggling with what they feel are unfair rules, what they want, they say, is for things to be fair.\n\n\u201cOur goal is fair maps that reflect the will of the people,\u201d Ward says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the outcome in 2022 to be a bunch of gerrymandered Democratic maps that break democracy in our favor.\u201d \n\nRepublicans, of course, could be forgiven for some skepticism on their sincerity. Democrats have often eagerly gerrymandered where they have happened to hold power, like in Maryland in 2010. And it\u2019s not idealists who would truly be in charge of redrawing the lines should Democrats regain power in these states, but self-interested politicians. We will have to wait and see how that turns out.\n\nYet this issue of \u201cfairness\u201d in the United States electoral system now goes broader than just House district maps. \n\nDonald Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by 2 percentage points \u2014 getting nearly 3 million votes fewer than she got \u2014 and is only president because of our bizarre Electoral College system. That\u2019s not an aberration; this was was the second time in the past five presidential elections that the Republican candidate won despite getting fewer votes than the Democrat.\n\nSimilarly, the Senate systematically advantages smaller, whiter, more rural states \u2014 60 senators represent states Trump won. If our politics become more racially polarized, or split more along a rural/urban divide, the Senate could soon become an institution systematically slanted in Republicans\u2019 favor.\n\nThis bias in presidential and Senate contests can wind up creating an imbalance on the Supreme Court \u2014 an institution that one would think might offer checks on the other two. Trump, a president who was elected with fewer votes than his opponent, has already gotten to appoint two justices, confirmed by a narrow Republican Senate majority (which refused to even hold a vote on Barack Obama\u2019s nominee Merrick Garland in 2016).\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the House. It was designed to be the most majoritarian body in the federal government \u2014 in contrast to the stuffy Senate and the elector-chosen president, it was supposed to have \u201can immediate dependence on, and an intimate sympathy with, the people,\u201d as Federalist Paper Number 52 reads. But now, deliberate gerrymandering has given Democrats a structural disadvantage there, too.\n\nTrends can be ephemeral, and political coalitions can change unpredictably. Yet if every electoral institution of the federal government of the United States of America has indeed developed to consistently disadvantage the Democratic Party from winning power even when it wins more votes, that\u2019s an enormous problem \u2014 a problem that could one day become a crisis .\n\nThis next redistricting battle \u2014 starting in November, as Democrats try to win the races that will let them redraw the next decade\u2019s maps \u2014 might provide a path toward staving off that crisis. To do that, though, the party has to win.\n",
