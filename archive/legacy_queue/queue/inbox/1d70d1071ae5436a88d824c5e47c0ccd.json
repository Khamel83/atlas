      "Selection": "Typically, we expect to spend money on travel and in\u00a0return, we\u2019re paid out in unique experiences, exposure to new cultures, and adventurous stories to bring home and share with friends.\u00a0 But now it\u2019s time to check all of your old airline receipts and flight itineraries.\u00a0 Did you fly on either American Airlines or Southwest Airlines between July 1, 2011, and June 14, 2018?\n\nIf you did, you may be entitled to part of the upcoming settlement these airlines are offering their passengers.\u00a0 That means money.\n\nBut if you aren\u2019t eligible for this payout, you can still save on travel using miles and points.\u00a0 To stay up to date on the latest tips & tricks, subscribe to our newsletter.\n\nYou Might be Eligible for a Payout From American Airlines or Southwest\n\nWhy Are Southwest & American Airlines Paying Out?\n\nLet\u2019s back up for a minute\u2026these airlines are paying their customers cash?\u00a0 What is going on here!?\n\nThis is in regards to a lawsuit that\u2019s going on with multiple airlines (Delta, United Airlines, Southwest, American Airlines, US Airways and Continental) stating that all airlines involved knowingly limited capacity on flights in order to increase their profits.\u00a0 In other words, they published less than they actually had available so they could charge more for those seats.\u00a0 Not cool.\u00a0 All of the airlines have denied this claim, but instead of waiting for the legal process to play out, Southwest and American Airlines have both agreed to settle now.\n\nThese payouts are not insignificant.\u00a0 Southwest is planning to pay out $15 million and American is tripling that with a $45 million payout.\u00a0 But given the number of people who will be involved in the settlement, the individual payouts probably won\u2019t be that much.\u00a0 But even $5 back is a cup of coffee at the airport so it\u2019s still worth looking into!\n\nHere\u2019s How to Qualify for a Payout\n\nMany people will have already received an email from the Domestic Airlines Antitrust Litigation Settlements containing information about the upcoming settlement.\u00a0 If you haven\u2019t received that email, your first step is to register here\u00a0to\u00a0continue to receive updates and new information as it\u2019s produced.\n\nYou\u2019ll qualify for a payout if you purchased a domestic flight on one or both of these airlines between:\n\n\u00a0 July 1, 2011, and December 20, 2017 (Southwest settlement)\n\n\u00a0 July 1, 2011 and June 14, 2018 (American settlement)\n\nWill You Get Money Back?\n\nSo far, the answer is that we don\u2019t know.\u00a0 Again, there\u2019s a good chance that with this many people involved it won\u2019t make sense to distribute this settlement money to everyone.\u00a0 After lawyers fees, court costs, and all of the other associated charges, the money will either be distributed to those involved in the case or to a charitable organization.\n\nIt definitely feels good to know that these airlines will be required to at\u00a0least donate the settlement money to an organization that is doing something positive in the world.\u00a0 And it\u2019s still worth following this case through settlement to see if you actually can expect some money back!\n\nIf you want to stay on top of other travel news, then subscribe to our newsletter. \u00a0And be sure to follow us on Instagram!\n",
