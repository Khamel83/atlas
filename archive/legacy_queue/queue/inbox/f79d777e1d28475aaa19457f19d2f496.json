      "Title": "The White House defended Kellyanne Conway by saying its employees don\u2019t have to follow ethics rules Vox - All",
      "Selection": "That argument did not go over well.\n\nThe White House tried to claim that federal ethics rules shouldn\u2019t apply to its employees. The Office of Government Ethics, responsible for making sure those rules are enforced, says that\u2019s not true.\n\nNow Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have written the White House counsel asking for clarification on the matter. \u201cThe President\u2019s staff need to follow ethics rules \u2014 not flout them,\u201d the letter read. \u201cWhen they violet these rules, the President must impose discipline, not invent a legal fiction that these rules do not apply.\u201d\n\nIn a letter last month responding to the flap over Kellyanne Conway\u2019s promotion of first daughter Ivanka Trump\u2019s Nordstrom merchandise, the White House said that \u201cmany\u201d federal ethics regulations don\u2019t apply to executive branch employees.\n\nNEW: @OfficeGovEthics sends letter to WH counsel and @GOPoversight taking issue with decision not to discipline @KellyannePolls. http://pic.twitter.com/NcgRJiCYyr\n\n\u2014 Alex Mallin (@alex_mallin) March 9, 2017\n\nThe real purpose of the letter was to explain what the White House was doing (or not doing) to discipline Conway after she endorsed Trump\u2019s products from the White House, a violation of federal ethics rules.\n\nOn February 9, Conway appeared on Fox & Friends in the midst of a one-sided fight between President Trump and Nordstrom department stores. The popular retailer had recently announced that it would stop carrying products from Ivanka Trump\u2019s fashion line. Conway, speaking from the White House briefing room, said, \u201cGo buy Ivanka\u2019s stuff, is what I would tell you.\u201d\n\nFederal ethics rules prohibit employees in the executive branch from endorsing \u201cany product, service, or enterprise.\u201d On February 13, OGE Director Walter Shaub sent a letter to the White House recommending that \u201cthe employing agency investigate the matter and consider taking disciplinary action.\u201d\n\nBut the top White House ethics official \u2014 Deputy Council for Compliance and Ethics Stefan Passantino \u2014 defended Conway against allegations of ethical violations. Writing in response to the OGE, Passantino described the conclusions of a White House \u201cinquiry\u201d:\n\nUpon completion of our inquiry, we concluded that Ms. Conway acted inadvertently and is highly unlikely to do so again. It is noted that Ms. Conway made the statement in question in a light, off-hand manner while attempting to stand up for a person she believed had been unfairly treated and did so without nefarious motives or intent to benefit personally. Both before and after receiving your letter, I personally met with Ms. Conway and advised her that her comments regarding Ms. Trump\u2019s products implicated the prohibition on using one\u2019s official position to endorse a product or service. Ms. Conway has acknowledged her understanding of the Standards and has reiterated her commitment to abiding by them in the future.\n\nPassantino also claimed that employees of the executive office of the president aren\u2019t bound by many federal ethics rules. Shaub was not impressed.\n\nThere is \u201cno legal basis\u201d for this claim, Shaub wrote in his response Thursday. Regardless of whether Conway is disciplined by the White House, all employees of the executive branch are subject to federal ethics rules. The only exceptions to that are the president and vice president, who are exempt from certain regulations under the theory that they have so much power that any action could pose a potential conflict.\n\nTrump, for his part, has touted this exemption in the past. \u201cThe president can\u2019t have a conflict of interest,\u201d he said in a November interview with the New York Times.\n\nOf course, Trump may have many conflicts of interest, and though he is exempt from certain regulations, several lawsuits have been filed against him arguing he violates the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which prohibits government officials from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments.",
