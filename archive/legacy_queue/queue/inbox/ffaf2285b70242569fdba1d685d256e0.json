      "Title": "Lil Miquela and the virtual influencer hype, explained Vox - All",
      "Selection": "There\u2019s no way that hot cartoons are actually the future of fashion advertising. Unless there\u2019s already too much money involved to stop them.\n \nEvery story about a virtual influencer starts the same way: She is beautiful. She has a ton of followers. She is mysterious, yet her personality is fantastic. She loves Calvin Klein. Also \u2014 she\u2019s not real! She was made by a computer to look as much like a hot and charming human being as possible without scaring people. Her body casts a shadow. She has flyaways and freckles. \n\nThe most famous example of the virtual influencer is Lil Miquela, who debuted on Instagram in April 2016, as if from nowhere. Of course, no arguably useless technological innovation actually comes from nowhere, and she was no exception. After months of speculation in Instagram comments and on news sites \u2014 with theories ranging from \u201cSims marketing stunt\u201d to \u201chorrifying social experiment\u201d \u2014 the secret was revealed and was shockingly mundane: Yeah, it\u2019s advertising. \n\nIn January, TechCrunch reported that Lil Miquela\u2019s creators had closed a $125 million investment round led by Spark Capital. Suddenly, virtual influencers were the future of ads. The future of fashion. The future of commerce. \n\nAre these lithe, high-resolution bodies really coming for the jobs held by models and scene kids for the last several decades?\n\nBut are these lithe, high-resolution bodies really coming for the jobs held by models and scene kids for the last several decades? There is little evidence so far that this is the case, beyond a handful of successful Instagram accounts and a lot of conversation. The way funding is heaped onto every startup that gets 15 minutes of attention from the press typically makes the success of bizarro-world innovations feel inevitable and unavoidable \u2014 the most barbed response we can summon the energy for is to drag out that same tired Jurassic Park meme about the hubris of making shit for no reason. (And if this isn\u2019t going to happen, why are people lining up to throw millions of dollars at it? We forget they are gambling.) \n\nThe virtual influencer could be a novelty technology, destined to flash in the pan like \u201choverboards\u201d or movie theaters equipped to spray people with \u201crain\u201d in the middle of Batman movies. Like the blockchain! Or you know, it could take all of the hot people\u2019s jobs. \n\nThere aren\u2019t really that many virtual influencers \u2014 yet. \n\nFirst, the cast of characters. Lil Miquela, the effortlessly hip forever-19-year-old with 1.5 million followers, also has two friends: Blawko, a boy and self-described \u201cyoung robot sex symbol\u201d whose mouth is constantly covered with designer pollution masks and who has a paltry 135,000 followers; and Bermuda, his ex-girlfriend and Lil Miquela\u2019s blonde, Trump-voting foil, whose bio boasts that she is a \u201cRobot/Unbothered mogul with daddy\u2019s PIN and a flawless highlight.\u201d All three were created by the team at the mysterious Los Angeles startup Brud for vague reasons. \n\nLil Miquela, the effortlessly hip forever-19-year-old, has 1.5 million followers.\n\nJenna Sauers, writing for Cultured in April, paid special attention to the strange myth-building Brud has done around its creations and its founders, some of which has included outright lies. Brud calls itself \u201ca technology startup specializing in artificial intelligence and robotics,\u201d she points out, and news outlets from Architectural Digest to CNN are simply parroting this verbatim. But \u201cBrud holds no patents in AI, robotics, or related fields,\u201d and Lil Miquela is little more than a well-crafted image. The piece walks through other exaggerations: co-founder Sara DeCou\u2019s one-time claim to be President Obama\u2019s \u201cspecial adviser on the ethics of AI development, and the other co-founder Terver McFedries\u2019s claim to have written a bill of rights for AIs.\u201d\n\nThe team has argued here and there that Lil Miquela\u2019s support of Black Lives Matter, reproductive rights, and LGBTQ+ causes can inspire real change. Last year, The Cut\u2019s Emilia Petrarca wrote about Brud\u2019s statement that it hoped to be the modern Will & Grace, saying \u201cAs with all things Brud, it\u2019s hard to tell if they\u2019re trolling us with this reference or if they\u2019ve been sipping too much of the Silicon Valley Kool-Aid.\u201d\n\n View this post on Instagram\n\n If I don't have tacos at least once a week, I glitch.

Anyone a casual tortilla con mantequilla kinda kid?\n \nA post shared by  *~ MIQUELA ~* (@lilmiquela) on Mar 6, 2019 at 5:06pm PST\n\nLess vague, Balmain creative director Olivier Rousteing\u2019s #BalmainArmy of virtual models. The first, Shudu, was designed by British photographer Cameron-James Wilson in early 2018. She racked up followers after the managers of the Instagram for Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty line apparently mistook her for a real customer and briefly reposted a photo of her \u201ctrying out\u201d the brand\u2019s matte lipstick. Shudu\u2019s bio declares her \u201cthe world\u2019s first digital supermodel,\u201d and she is much taller and more classically beautiful than Lil Miquela. In 2018, Rousteing hired Wilson to make two more digital supermodels, exclusively for Balmain. He came up with Xhi \u2014 a gorgeous Chinese woman modeled after David Bowie \u2014 and Margot \u2014 a gorgeous French woman modeled after Rousteing\u2019s childhood fantasies about French women. Neither Xhi nor Margot have their own Instagram accounts, and they exist solely for Balmain ads.\n\nMy personal favorite is Lu, the very strange virtual influencer who appears in ads for Brazil\u2019s Bed Bath & Beyond-equivalent Magazine Luiza. She listens to Lana Del Rey while she jogs. When I first learned this about her, I was moved enough to write about it for Racked, asking \u201cWhile she is deliberately dragging down her own morning jog vibe with music about the disposability of the female body, the danger of icons, and the inherent violence of American popular culture, is Lu also subtly ribbing Lil Miquela, all of her ilk, and me?\u201d \n\nConversations about diversity and representation in the fashion industry were already at a fever pitch. An influx of avatars makes it even more complicated.\n\nThis brings us to the controversy of virtual influencers. They are physically perfect women made of pixels, standing in for women who have long been pressured to become physically perfect, without the advantage of that even being possible. Lil Miquela herself acknowledged this, sort of, when she asked YouTube conspiracy theorist Shane Dawson, in response to a question about the manipulation of her image, \u201cCan you name one person on Instagram who doesn\u2019t edit their photos?\u201d The women of the fashion industry and particularly of Instagram are already pushed to Photoshop themselves, or to real-life-Photoshop themselves, which is to say \u201cget cosmetic surgery.\u201d \n\nIsn\u2019t it interesting the way we can talk out both sides of our mouths, simultaneously espousing a new age of body positivity and self-acceptance, while also making it clear that supermodels are incapable of reaching beauty standards set by things that are not even alive? \n\n View this post on Instagram\n\n Shudu @thesavoylondon trying on beautiful #EEBAFTAs outfits, complete with @atelierswarovski earrings. 6 days to go till she shares #redcarpet looks with you all. . @ee @BAFTA . . #3D #3Dart #digitalsupermodel #worldsfirstdigitalsupermodel #virtualinfluencer #BTS\n \nA post shared by  Shudu (@shudu.gram) on Feb 4, 2019 at 11:07am PST\n\nTo add insult to injury, this collection of virtual influencers is far more diverse than the roster of brand ambassadors and runway models that major fashion brands have employed for most of their existence. This May, Calvin Klein rolled out its #MYTRUTH campaign, which featured actual famous people like Troye Sivan, Billie Eilish, and the brand\u2019s favorite permalancer A$AP Rocky. It also involved a video in which supermodel Bella Hadid made out with Lil Miquela. In her Calvins! This was a disaster, with critics immediately pointing out the double whammy: In the first place, it was queer-baiting, presenting two women kissing as exotic and bizarre. But also, could they not even cast an actual gay person? There are limits to the usefulness of \u201crepresentation,\u201d seen here when a job that could have gone to an underrepresented group went instead to a collection of pixels with no personal political context at all. \n\nThere are limits to the usefulness of \u201crepresentation\u201d \u2014 e.g. when you replace real people with avatars.\n\nIn an email newsletter, the writer Rob Horning compared this to Time\u2019s infamous 1993 cover for its \u201cNew Face of America\u201d immigration issue, which showed a surreally smooth, smiling face \u2014 a computer-generated projection of what future \u201cderacialized\u201d generations of America might look like. Lil Miquela, he argues, is \u201ca figure from an idealized future where human difference is resolved not through political struggle but through process of automated averaging and morphing. ... a visual expression of an algorithmic sublime.\u201d \n\nSimilar criticism was levied at Shudu, a black woman avatar designed by a white man. Writing for the New Yorker, Lauren Michele Jackson says the character reminds her of black minstrelsy and dryly quotes the creator saying that his biggest influence was \u201ca special-edition Princess of South Africa Barbie doll.\u201d \n\nAlso ... these things are just plain scary? \n\nThe term \u201cuncanny valley\u201d was coined by the Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori in 1970. It refers to the feeling of discomfort we experience when something is close enough to human-looking or seeming to trick our brains into approaching it that way \u2014 but we can\u2019t be fooled fully. We always find what\u2019s wrong. \n\nLil Miquela speaks as if she is a person with feelings. In a cover story for High Snobiety last April, she\u2019s quoted at length. Discussing her critics, she tells a reporter via email, \u201cI think people feel a little vulnerable in general right now. They have a lot of frustration and need something to target it at, usually it\u2019s something that they don\u2019t understand. So, I try not to let it get to me too much, because it\u2019s a symptom of people trying to digest all of the change happening every day.\u201d \n\nThis is not so different really than other types of first-person speech on the part of brands \u2014 Sunny-D threatening to kill itself, HBO texting its boss (?) \u2014 because despite what her copywriters would tell you, Lil Miquela is not actually a robot. None of this is artificial intelligence. It\u2019s just computer motion graphics and captions written with, one can only guess, a meticulous company style guide. \n\nWow - \u2066@lilmiquela\u2069 billboard in Times Square pic.twitter.com/QPaIRu8ApV\n\u2014 adam bain (@adambain) August 18, 2018\n\nAs Business of Fashion\u2019s Christopher Morency pointed out in February 2018, virtual celebrities aren\u2019t exactly new either. We are more than two decades out from the founding of virtual band Gorillaz, and 13 years past their first Grammy win. The Japanese virtual pop star Hatsune Miku has been on multiple arena tours and was dressed in 2013 by Marc Jacobs. Louis Vuitton hired a Final Fantasy character for a 2016 ad campaign. Lil Miquela is more technically complicated than these characters, but not by much. \n\nThe Verge\u2019s Julia Alexander explained in January that, while Lil Miquela herself does not involve any AI or robotics, she might motivate the creation of a virtual influencer who could: \n\nHer success has inspired venture capitalists like Betaworks to invest heavily in virtual creators and work with startups to progress the technology forward. The future of influencers, according to the general director of Betaworks\u2019 startup boot camp, Danika Laszuk, is digital beings who actually are powered by AI. Betaworks\u2019 next startup camp will focus on what Laszuk calls \u201csynthetic media\u201d \u2014 a combination of computer-generated imagery and AI capabilities. The company plans to make a series of $200,000 investments in 10 startups that want to build technology that can create better digital influencers. \n\nAlexander goes on to paint a picture of a future in which virtual influencers need no human assistance at all once they\u2019re published, and quotes Edward Saatchi, the co-founder of \u201cvirtual beings\u201d company Fable Studio, who promises to make influencers who can move between platforms. They\u2019d be, basically, sentient avatars dancing between YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and so on, using machine learning to talk and evolve. \n\nWhether digital influencers catch on or not, the fashion industry is about to spend a ton of money on them\n\nThe biggest selling point of virtual influencers if you work in advertising or fashion isn\u2019t the perfection of an avatar\u2019s body or face but the predictability of its behavior. \n\n\u201cYou remove some of the PR risks from influencers who may do something that could impact [your] base of customers,\u201d Andrew Dunst, a vice president at the marketing and software conglomerate Sage Group told WWD last July. \u201cEverything this virtual influencer does is in a controlled setting by the people who are managing that account.\u201d It\u2019s a funny argument. The biggest public relations risks for brands have never been the paycheck-dependent influencers or rigorously trained celebrities who stand at the front of their ad campaigns \u2014 it\u2019s always been the tone deafness or general idiocy of the people behind the campaigns, the immoral or poorly executed business decisions made the people in charge, or the simple undesirability of whatever they\u2019re selling. \n\n View this post on Instagram\n\n Fell asleep reading lol Anyone else get sleepy when it\u2019s warm out?

Named Liam Nikuro, he\u2019s an \u201call-CG head made with the use of 3-D tools on a body filmed in live action,\u201d and he will find work in music, fashion, and entertainment as a \u201cmultimedia producer,\u201d according to his creators. This will involve \u201cinnovative creative content in combination with AI technology,\u201d although what exactly that might mean goes unexplained. Liam loves 2Pac and Justin Bieber, he says; Juniper Research estimates that the global fashion industry will invest $3.6 billion in artificial intelligence technology this year.\n\n\u201cThe boundary between science fiction and social reality is an optical illusion,\u201d Donna Haraway wrote in her famous 1985 essay \u201cA Cyborg Manifesto.\u201d She was talking about possible futures for feminism and ways to use technology to make bodies more livable \u2014 as well as society more ethically coherent while more emotionally and intellectually ambivalent \u2014 and she was not at all talking about the question of Lil Miquela. This was decades before commercial social media!\n\nStill, it\u2019s striking how well her somewhat trollish predictions have held up. We are spending so much time riddling out whether we can trust robots to represent us or sell us underpants, whether these images are robots at all, whether the people behind them can be trusted, whether any of it matters. At this point, if it\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re doing. \n\nSign up for The Goods newsletter.
