      "Title": "Where American Criminal Justice Went Wrong [via Longreads]",
      "Selection": "William Stuntz, a conservative law professor at Harvard, was suffering from colon cancer and spent the last three years of his life working on a book that aimed to rethink how our justice system has failed: <br /> <br /> \n\n\"Stuntz submitted his completed manuscript to his editor at Harvard University Press in January 2011, about three months before he died at age 52. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006TT3V5C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=longreads-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B006TT3V5C\"><em>The Collapse of American Criminal Justice</em></a> was published the following fall. In it, Stuntz describes how America\u2019s incarceration rate came to be the highest in the industrial world; how the country\u2019s young black males came to bear the brunt of its increasingly harsh penal code; and how jury trials became so rare that more than 95 percent of people sent to prison never had their guilt or innocence deliberated in court.\"",
