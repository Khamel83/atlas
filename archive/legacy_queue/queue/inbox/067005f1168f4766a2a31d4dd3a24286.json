      "Selection": "If you\u2019re wondering how to make all of your Chase Ultimate Rewards points more valuable and how to\u00a0have access to tons of money-saving benefits and perks, the\u00a0Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae\u00a0is the answer to your question. Currently, it has a 50,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points welcome bonus, which you can earn after spending $4,000 on purchases within the first three months of account opening.\n\nSome people are scared off by the card\u2019s $450 annual fee. But you might be surprised to hear that the yearly benefits are easily worth much more than that. You even get a $300 travel credit every cardmember year that applies to a wide range of purchases (more on this later). I\u2019ll show you why it\u2019s one of the best credit cards for travel.\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Preferred benefits make it perhaps THE best travel credit card. (Photo by Wyatt Smith)\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve benefits and perks\n\nUnlike other Chase Ultimate Rewards earning cards,\u00a0you can redeem points on the\u00a0Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00a0for 1.5 cents each when you use them to pay for travel booked through the Chase Travel Portal. That makes it the best Chase credit card on the market.\n\nOne handy benefit of this card is that you can transfer the Chase Ultimate Rewards points you earn from other cards to this card, and they are instantly worth 1.5 cents each through the Chase Portal.\n\nAlso, with the Chase Sapphire Reserve, you have the ability to transfer your Chase Ultimate Rewards points to Chase transfer partners:\n\nAer Lingus\n\nBritish Airways\n\nEmirates\n\nFlying Blue (Air France & KLM)\n\nHyatt\n\nIberia\n\nIHG\n\nJetBlue\n\nMarriott\n\nSingapore Airlines\n\nSouthwest\n\nUnited Airlines\n\nVirgin Atlantic\n\nThis is an incredibly valuable perk, and the best way to use Chase points. But those aren\u2019t the only airlines you can travel on with Chase Ultimate Rewards points \u2014 you can use one airlines\u2019 miles to book award flights with their partner airlines. For example, you can use British Airways Avios points to book American Airlines award seats, and Flying Blue miles can be used to book Delta flights. Read our full Chase Ultimate Rewards review for more details.\n\nYearly $300 travel credit\n\nI know that the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u2019s $450 annual fee looks scary up front, but it\u2019s not as daunting as it seems because the card has one of the best travel credit perks of any premium credit card. Every cardmember year you\u2019ll get the first $300 spent on travel automatically reimbursed as a statement credit. So you can look at it as prepaying $300 in purchases you were going to make anyway. What qualifies for the travel credit? Lots of stuff, including:\n\nAirfare\n\nHotels, Airbnb, timeshares and campgrounds\n\nRental cars,\u00a0Uber,\u00a0trains and\u00a0buses\n\nTolls and\u00a0parking\n\nCruises and ferries\n\nThere are two things to note about the travel credit. The first is that while you normally earn 3X Chase Ultimate Rewards points on travel purchases, the $300 in travel that is reimbursed as part of the credit won\u2019t earn any points. So you\u2019re sacrificing 900 Chase Ultimate Rewards points in exchange for $300. I\u2019ll take that trade any day of the week.\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve card\u2019s travel credit applies to lots of purchases, including cruises.

This is the case with some vacation rentals because they might code as a real estate transaction instead of travel. Lots of people report that Airbnb stays do count as travel, but sometimes rentals through VRBO or HomeAway don\u2019t end up coding that way.\n\nMost people I know spend much more than $300 combined in qualifying travel categories. So after the travel credit, you only need to get $150 a year in value from the Chase Sapphire Reserve to make it worth keeping. And as you\u2019ll see, that\u2019s not hard to do.\n\nEarn 3X Chase Ultimate Rewards bonus points on dining and travel\n\nIf you want to amass Chase Ultimate Rewards points as quickly as possible, spending with the Chase Sapphire Reserve is the best way to accomplish that goal (other than earning a big intro bonus by opening a new card). With it, you\u2019ll earn 3X Chase Ultimate Rewards points on every qualifying travel and dining purchase.\n\nThis is also a great card to use while your traveling because not only does it not have any foreign transaction fees, but the 3X bonus for dining and travel applies to worldwide purchases. This isn\u2019t the case with other travel rewards credit cards.\n\nTSA PreCheck or Global Entry credit\n\nDo you know what can really mess up a trip? Getting stuck in the airport security line and then missing your flight. So instead, you end up compensating by showing up way too early for every flight, then you\u2019re stuck hanging out in the crowded airport longer than necessary. It\u2019s a lose-lose situation.\n\nThe answer is TSAPreCheck or Global Entry (which comes with TSA PreCheck). Once you\u2019re approved for it you can use an expedited security line (if your airport has one) when you\u2019re flying with any of 60+ eligible airlines. Plus you won\u2019t have to remove your shoes, belt or laptop. It makes airport security a breeze. It even saved Joseph from missing his flight and having to purchase a nearly $600 replacement flight. You can\u2019t beat that!\n\nNormally TSA PreCheck costs $85 and Global Entry costs $100. Both are valid for five years. But if you pay either of those fees with your Chase Sapphire Reserve you\u2019ll get the fee reimbursed up to $100, so it ends up being free. This credit replenishes every four years, so every time you need to renew your TSA PreCheck or Global Entry it will be free as long as you keep your Sapphire Reserve card.\n\nAirport lounge access\n\nWith the Chase Sapphire Reserve, you won\u2019t need to dream of whiling away the hours of an unreasonably long connecting flight in a comfortable airport lounge with fast WiFi and complimentary food because it will be a reality for you.\u00a0The card comes with a Priority Pass membership that is far more valuable than even the most expensive Priority Pass membership you can purchase \u2013 I\u2019ll explain.\n\nThe best Priority Pass membership you can buy costs $429 per year and with it, you get free unlimited access to the 1,200+ lounges in the network. But you\u2019ll need to pay $32 for each guest you want to bring along. But with the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u2019s Priority Pass membership you get the same unlimited lounge access for yourself and two guests \u2014 and if you need to bring a third person along, it\u2019s only $27 extra. If you travel with a partner and child that\u2019s an easy $64 in savings per visit over purchasing a membership.\n\nPriority Pass lounges are all over the world \u2014 if you\u2019re an international traveler, you\u2019ll love its sizable 1,200+ lounge portfolio. (Photo by Katie Genter)\n\nOne of the hidden benefits of Priority Pass membership is that there are a growing number of airport restaurants that will accept your Priority Pass membership. Right now there are ~30 in the US alone. The rules vary slightly depending on the location, but in general, you\u2019ll just need a same-day boarding pass and proof of your Priority Pass membership and you\u2019ll get $28 to $32 dollars off your bill per person for up to two people. That\u2019s an easy $56 to $64 off a good meal.\u00a0And afterward, you\u2019ll still have the option to relax in an airport lounge.\n\nPrimary rental car insurance\n\nThe rental car insurance that comes with the Chase Sapphire Reserve is primary coverage. That means you can decline the rental company\u2019s collision damage waiver and it will still cover you for theft or damages. That\u2019s a very real costs savings that could easily be $15+ per day. And filing a claim is pretty straight forward. Harlan was reimbursed for almost $700 in charges thanks to the rental insurance he got by paying for a rental with his Chase Sapphire Reserve.\n\nBest Trip Delay insurance\n\nTrip Delay insurance is one of those perks that\u2019s easy to overlook until you need it. Just last year alone I was reimbursed over $500 from two separate Trip Delay insurance claims with my\u00a0Ink Business Preferred\u2120 Credit Card and\u00a0Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card. The Trip Delay insurance for both of these cards covers expenses you incur as the result of an eligible trip delay, including:\n\nGround transportation (rental, taxi, etc.)\n\nLodging\n\nFood\n\nIncidentals (toiletries, clothing, medications, etc.)\n\nThe coverage you get with those cards only applies to delays that are 12+ hours long or require an overnight stay and will cover you for up to $500 per ticket.\u00a0 What you get with the Chase Sapphire Reserve is much more useful.\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve\u2019s Trip Delay coverage will reimburse you for the same $500 per ticket, but it covers delays of six hours or more, or ones that require an overnight stay. That\u2019s a big difference.\n\nDelayed baggage insurance\n\nThe\u00a0Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00a0gives travelers $100 per day for up to five days if a bag has been delayed for six hours or more. This is a benefit many of us on the team have had to use. If you\u2019ve never had a lost or delayed bag, it\u2019s only a matter of time!\n\nLost luggage insurance\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00a0will cover the cost to repair or replace lost luggage and personal items. You\u2019ll receive up to $3,000 per person each trip,\u00a0with a limit of\u00a0$500\u00a0for items such as jewelry and electronics.\n\nTrip cancellation and interruption insurance\n\nThis perk will provide you with up to $10,000 per person per covered trip (maximum $20,000 per occurrence). You\u2019ll receive up to $40,000 per 12-month period.\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve cardholders can take advantage of the roadside assistance benefits, which means you can save on annual fees with programs like AAA.\n\nSome of the coverage could be so valuable that just using it once could pay for the card many times over.\n\nEmergency evacuation and transportation\n\nWhen you pay for a trip with your\u00a0Chase Sapphire Reserve card, you\u2019ll have\u00a0emergency evacuation and transportation benefits if you are injured or become ill during your trip. The\u00a0maximum coverage amount is $100,000, which may seem like a lot, but evacuation from a remote location can be extremely expensive.\n\nCoverage with the Sapphire Reserve is\u00a0supplemental, meaning you\u2019ll be covered after any primary coverage you may have.\u00a0The following people will have emergency evacuation coverage as long as you pay for all or part of their trip with your Chase Sapphire Reserve:\n\nCardholder\n\nCardholder\u2019s spouse\n\nLegally dependent children under age 18 (age 25 if enrolled as a full-time student)\n\nChase Luxury Hotel & Resort Collection benefits\n\nThe Luxury Hotel & Resort Collection\u00a0is available to many Chase credit cards, the Chase Sapphire Reserve being one of them. If you book through the\u00a0Chase Luxury Hotel & Resort Collection, you\u2019ll get the following perks:\n\nComplimentary Wi-Fi\n\nSpecial benefit unique to each hotel (i.e. hotel credit, etc.)\n\nFree daily breakfast for two\n\nEarly check-in (if available)\n\nLate check-out (if available)\n\nRoom upgrade (if available)\n\nYou\u2019ll even get a special benefit, like a $100 food credit, a spa credit, etc. I booked a stay through the\u00a0Chase LHR\u00a0Collection for my wife and me at the Park Hyatt Chicago, and we received a $100 credit toward a fancy dinner, free breakfast, late check-out, and a small room upgrade. Plus, we still earned Hyatt points for the stay.\n\nTo receive these benefits, book through the\u00a0Luxury Hotel & Resort Collection website or with one of their travel specialists and use your eligible Chase card to purchase your stay.\n\nOverall value\n\nLet me first say that if you\u2019re a casual traveler who travels domestically once or twice a year to visit the family for the holidays, this card is probably overkill for you. If you fly more often, or if you take an international trip or two each year, you\u2019ll do well with this card.\n\nThe first year you have this card, expect to receive $1,829 in value:\n\n$1,000 \u2013 50,000 point sign-up bonus (based on our estimation of Chase points value)\n\n$300 \u2013 annual travel credit that automatically triggers when you use your card for a travel purchase\n\n$100 \u2013 Statement credit for Global Entry and TSA PreCheck\n\n$429 \u2013 Value of a Priority Pass lounge membership\n\nHowever, after the first year you can expect to receive a value of $829 (the only difference will be no sign-up bonus). This is an unbelievably conservative estimate, considering:\n\nYou\u2019ll save money hand over fist if you use the card\u2019s primary rental car insurance with any frequency\n\nYou\u2019ll earn 3\u00a0Chase points per dollar at restaurants and on travel\n\nYou\u2019ll inevitably receive compensation from Chase for a canceled flight or delayed bags thanks to its top-notch travel insurance\n\nAgain, if you don\u2019t travel often, the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00a0benefits won\u2019t be worth as much to you.\n\nBottom line\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00a0has all the bells and whistles you could want from a premium travel credit card. And while it does have a $450 annual fee, it\u2019s surprisingly easy to get many times that in value each year you have the card. The annual travel credit alone will reimburse for the first $300 in eligible travel purchases you make each cardmember year. And other perks like the generous Priority Pass Membership and TSA Precheck/Global Entry free credit are worth more than $150 combined to most people.\n\nBut maybe the biggest reason to get the card s the fact that it can make all of your other Chase Ultimate Rewards points more valuable. With the card, you can use your Ultimate Rewards points to book travel through the Chase Travel Portal at a rate of 1.5 cents each, which is up to 50% more than other Chase Ultimate Rewards cards.\n\nYou can apply for the Chase Sapphire Reserve card here.\n\nIf you want more tips, tricks, and secrets to make the most of your miles & points, then subscribe to our newsletter.\n",
