      "Title": "We Tested 5 of the Most Popular Magical Recipes on the Internet Food52",
      "Selection": "So\u00a0you don't have to.\n\nMagical one-ingredient banana ice cream\n\nRecipes make lofty claims. Too many\u00a0call themselves the best, while\u00a0some take it a step further (\"the world's best\") and some are a bit\u00a0more humble (\"very good\").\u00a0\n\nBut perhaps the grandest, most far-fetched claims of all are those of \"magical\" two- or three-ingredient recipes that purport to produce great results with 10 fewer ingredients and much,\u00a0much\u00a0less work. \"Turns out you've been doing too much all along!\" they sing. \"You don't have to buy extra ingredients or cream any butter or\u00a0wait for dough to rise. You're doing it wrong:\u00a0Life could be so easy!\"\u00a0\n\nThey\u00a0run wild on the internet as panacea: They're the GET RICH FAST recipes, the con men of the blogosphere, smiling at me slyly.\u00a0\n\nBut what if it's true? What if life\u00a0could\u00a0be easier? To see if I've really been doing too much work (mixing 15-ingredient cakes like a fool\u00a0stuck in\u00a0the 20th century), I put 5 of the most popular magical recipes to the test.\n\nSo did my life change, you're wondering? No, not really. The prospect of every single one of these recipes was equal parts puzzling and exciting, but once I tasted the finished product and moved beyond the gimmick, I was disappointed. Yes, there were a couple of recipe\u00a0I'd return to\u00a0(namely, the cheesecake\u00a0and the pizza dough), but not one could go head-to-head with\u00a0its fully-fledged namesake; in the end, they're\u00a0knock-offs. They\u00a0might be great as party tricks\u2014or if you have a\u00a0dietary restriction, or you're in a very desperate, very unusual circumstance\u2014but they won't replace your stand-bys.\u00a0\n\nRead about each recipe here, or skip straight to the takeaways:\n\n1.\u00a0Two-Ingredient Banana Pancakes\n2.\u00a0Two-Ingredient Ice Cream Bread\n3.\u00a0Three-Ingredient Japanese Cheesecake\n4.\u00a0Two-Ingredient Maple Souffl\u00e9s\n5.\u00a0Two-Ingredient Pizza Dough\n\n1. The recipe: Two-Ingredient Banana Pancakes, as seen on\u00a0The Kitchn\u00a0and\u00a0Tasting Table\n\n\u00a0\u00a0I was especially proud of the pancake on the right, as it resembled a toy rocket/squid.\n\nThe ingredients:\u00a0Banana + egg\n\nThe method: Mash up 1\u00a0ripe banana, add 2\u00a0eggs, and mix, mix, mix. You'll get a really soupy batter. You'll worry that you're about to make banana-flavored scrambled eggs. Heat up a griddle with some butter, dollop in 2 tablespoons of the loose batter, wait 1 to 2 minutes, then flip very, very carefully, as if you are handling a still-wet\u00a0painting, and cook a minute more. Serve immediately.\n\nThe experience: While we all agreed that these pancakes could use some salt, cinnamon, and maple syrup, everyone who tried them was pleasantly surprised. They were definitely\u00a0on the eggy side of the eggy-fluffy pancake spectrum,\u00a0but the texture was chewier and\u00a0breadier\u00a0than we expected\u2014akin to a hefty version of a banana-flavored cr\u00eape. They're squishier and wetter than your normal pancake, with a flavor that, if you use enough butter in the pan, recalls the outside of French toast.\u00a0\n\nThe verdict:\u00a0Though these didn't stack up to traditional pancakes, yes, we would make them again.\u00a0They're lacking lift and\u00a0levity, but they're probably the best thing you can do with 1 banana and 2 eggs.\u00a0Kenzi\u00a0even said she might make them for dinner.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. The recipe: Two-Ingredient Ice Cream\u00a0Bread, as seen on\u00a0Good Housekeeping\n\nCan you tell what ice cream flavor we used from those mysterious chunks?\n\nThe ingredients:\u00a0Ice cream + self-rising flour\n\nThe method: Mix together 1 1/2 cups self-rising flour with 2 cups of softened ice cream (we chose Talenti butter pecan). Scoop into a loaf pan and bake in a 350\u00b0 F oven for 45 minutes (ours took only 35).\n\nThe experience:\u00a0This very short loaf (you can see how stout the slices are in the photo above) tasted more like pancakes than the banana pancakes did, but we attribute that to the butter pecan ice cream we used as the base. Flavor-wise, the cake was saltier than we expected (a result of the self-rising flour and, perhaps, that the flavor of ice cream is created with the cold temperature at which it is eaten in mind); texturally, it was buttery and dense, but with a pasty quality that dried out our mouths.\n\nThe verdict: No, we probably wouldn't make this again.\u00a0If we happened to have a pint of melting ice cream on our hands and no blender with which to make a milkshake (note: this has never\u00a0happened), we might\u00a0make this cake\u2014but we wouldn't be particularly proud to call it our own. We wouldn't bring it to a dinner party or turn to it for a snack. Yes, the cake is impressive\u00a0if you keep in mind that it's made of only two ingredients, but in comparison to fully-formed cakes, it's not good\u2014just not bad.\u00a0It's probably just better to eat the melted ice cream.\n\n\u00a0\n\n3. The recipe: Three-Ingredient Japanese Cheesecake, as seen in this 4.8-million hit YouTube video\u00a0and on Epicurious\u00a0\n\nThe ingredients:\u00a0White chocolate + cream cheese + eggs\n\nThe method:\u00a0Melt white chocolate in the microwave and mix in a whole block of room temperature cream cheese and 6 egg yolks. Whip the 6 egg whites to stiff\u00a0peaks, then fold them gradually into the cream cheese mixture. Bake in a spring-form pan (the recipe says 8-inch, but we used an 8 1/2) in a water bath at 350\u00b0 F for 45 minutes, then turn off the oven and leave the cake in for 15 minutes. Chill overnight.\u00a0\n\nThe experience:\u00a0I was so skeptical of this cheesecake, which was sadly\u00a0short and with a burnished cap, neither of which were described in the method I was following. My knife didn't float through this cake\u2014I had to apply more pressure than I was expecting\u2014and\u00a0it wasn't as smooth or soft as those cheescakes I've loved in the past. But while it might not compare to a towering, soft, yielding cheesecake (and there's no crust!), it is good in its own right: Smooth and lush and sweet, it tastes way more like eggs than white chocolate (the latter is practically undetectable); the Food52 tasters described it as a fallen souffl\u00e9 and a firm, cheesy flan.\n\nThe verdict: Yes, we'd make it again. If you are the person who wants to soft-as-snow cheesecake, this dessert might not be for you. And it's\u00a0missing the characteristic tang of cheesecake and would benefit from\u00a0some salt and lemon zest. (More ingredients!)\u00a0Lauren Kelley\u00a0smartly suggested we try it again using\u00a0goat cheese instead of cream cheese. That being said, this is\u00a0much easier to make than a traditional cheesecake and would taste great topped with fruit compote or lemon curd. We would not be embarrassed to serve this to friends.\n\n\u00a0\n\n4. The recipe: Two-ingredient Maple Souffl\u00e9, as seen on\u00a0Sugarlaws\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Is there a disappointment greater than a fallen souffl\u00e9?\n\nThe ingredients: Maple syrup + eggs\n\nThe method:\u00a0Mix 2 egg yolks with 1/3 cup maple syrup. Whip the 2 egg whites to soft peaks. Fold the maple mixture into the egg whites, pour into ramekins, and stick in a 400\u00b0 F oven. Immediately lower the temperature to 375\u00b0 F and bake for 10 minutes, until puffed and browned.\n\nThe experience: I had a hard time incorporating\u00a0the maple syrup mixture into the egg whites, and when I poured the mixture into the ramekins, I noticed that the syrup sank to the bottom. I cried failure. But, 10 minutes later,\u00a0it seemed the syrup had osmosed throughout the egg mixture. The souffl\u00e9s were nicely browned and, fleetingly, quite inflated. When we punctured them, we found a damp, marshy mush\u2014there was the same sponginess that characterizes a normal\u00a0souffl\u00e9, but here, that sponge was saturated with syrup.\u00a0\n\nThe taste is not surprising: If you've ever eaten scrambled eggs that got too cozy with the maple syrup dripping off\u00a0your pancakes, you'll understand. If you're looking for a different textural experience in which to experience this same flavor combination\u2014or to impress some friends with food balloons\u2014this works well enough.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0The wet and spongy texture (right); a mysteriously cavernous souffl\u00e9 (right).\n\nThe verdict: No, we wouldn't make it again.\u00a0We'll\u00a0stick to scrambled eggs and save the precious maple syrup for something better. If you like damp food like soggy French toast or day-old custards, this might be for you.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. The recipe: Two-Ingredient Pizza Dough, as seen on Impatient Foodie\u00a0\n\nThe ingredients: Greek yogurt + self-rising flour\n\nThe method: Mix 1 cup of Greek yogurt (we used full-fat) with 1 cup self-rising flour. Knead for 8 to 10 minutes on a lightly-floured surface, then shape into a \"pizza shape\" (I used a rolling pin) and bake in a 450\u00b0 F oven for 10 minutes. (The recipe instructs to put it \"straight in the oven\"\u2014I put one piece of dough directly on the oven rack and placed the other on a preheated baking sheet.)\n\nThe experience:\u00a0I couldn't believe how easy this dough was to handle. On the intial mix, it seemed like it would very, very dry, but the yogurt hydrated the flour, and it ended up being slightly sticky. I added additional self-rising flour as I kneaded and rolled the dough, and, rare for me, experienced no dough anxiety as I went along.\u00a0\n\nI was happy with how the dough was chewy and airy in some parts and crisp and cracker-y in others. I wish I had topped it with sauce or vegetables to see how all the different components interacted, but as flatbread, this dough was\u00a0enjoyable, if\u00a0missing the complex flavor that comes from a yeast rise. There was a slight chemical taste from the self-rising flour (probably my fault\u2014I should have kneaded with all-purpose). Caroline\u00a0said it reminded her of a better version of the dollar pizza crust (and she insisted that that was a good thing).\u00a0\n\nThe dough that went directly on the oven rack (top) vs.\u00a0the dough that went on the baking sheet (bottom).\u00a0\n\nThe verdict: Considering how poor my last pizza dough-making experience went (screaming fight! dough in the trash! many tears!),\u00a0I would\u00a0certainly make this again. Without waiting\u00a0for dough\u00a0to rise,\u00a0you'll have something very closely resembling real-life pizza dough. And while you'd never mistake it for a wood-fired crust from Roberta's, it's much better than the large sponge\u00a0you find at the grocery store. Plus, you don't have to play yeast roulette.\u00a0\n\nSo what did we learn?\n\nEggs are magical! Look at everything they can do! But, surprise: When eggs are one\u00a0of two or three ingredients in your recipe, it's going to taste eggy.\n\nAnd, similarly, two or three ingredient recipes probably aren't going to have complex flavor profiles.\n\nSelf-rising flour probably doesn't count as one ingredient, but it's a great cheater's move: It's already got baking powder and salt.\u00a0\n\nThese recipes are all super easy and impressive in their resourcefulness, but compared to the real deal, they're not going to wow you. If you want something that's quick bread-like or pancake-like or cheesecake-like, these are all great options. But if you have the energy and endurance to go for the real deal, we'd recommend that.\n\nMake the pizza dough first, then try the cheescake. If you have a banana and two eggs, make the pancakes. Leave the souffl\u00e9 and the ice cream bread for another day.\u00a0\n\nAre there any magical recipes you swear by? Tell us in the comments!\n",
