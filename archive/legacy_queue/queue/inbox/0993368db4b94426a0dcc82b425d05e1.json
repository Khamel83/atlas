      "Title": "This cartographer\u2019s deep dive into Google Maps is fascinating The Verge",
      "Selection": "Most people who use Google Maps do so without much attention to detail. We just need the directions, the right subway route, or the name of that good sushi place. We don\u2019t spend too much time pondering how Google got so good at mapping the world, and what decisions and choices were made along the way that have made it the go-to navigational tool of our time. \n\nJustin O\u2019Beirne pays attention to these types of details. He\u2019s a cartographer who helped contribute to Apple Maps. So we should trust him when he explains \u2014 in depth \u2014 about what makes Google Maps so superior to any other mapping service. \n\nwhat makes Google Maps so superior\n\nThis week, he published a fascinating essay that explains the concept of the \u201cGoogle Maps\u2019 Moat.\u201d By this, he means the layers of data surrounding Google Maps that basically makes it basically impossible for Apple or any competitor to ever catch up. \u201cGoogle has gathered so much data, in so many areas, that it\u2019s now crunching it together and creating features that Apple can\u2019t make \u2014 surrounding Google Maps with a moat of time,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt makes you wonder how long back Google was planning all of this\u2014and what it\u2019s planning next...\u201d\n\nO\u2019Beirne starts out by marveling at the level of detail available in Google Maps for even extremely small towns, such as the one where he grew up in rural Illinois. He highlights how Google, unlike Apple, is able to display the shapes of individual buildings and even smaller structures like tool sheds and mobile homes. These minute details can be found even in towns with populations in the double-digits. He uses this to lament the corresponding lack of detail in Apple Maps. \n\nHe charts the history of Google\u2019s efforts to add buildings large and small, highlighting the search giant\u2019s announcement from 2012 that they were \u201calgorithmically created by taking aerial imagery and using computer vision techniques to render the building shapes.\u201d So in addition to getting a first-person street view of your route, you can zoom outward to seeing a computer-rendered model of the surrounding area for contextual information such as the shapes and sizes of buildings.\n\n\u201cHow long until Google has every structure on Earth?\u201d\n\nHe concludes that aerial imagery from satellites has outpaced Google\u2019s famous Street View vehicles in the amount of data used to create these vivid tableaus. And he asks an important question: \u201c[H]ow long until Google has every structure on Earth?\u201d\n\nThen things get interesting. O\u2019Beirne introduces us to two researchers, Rachelle Annechino and Yo-Shang Cheng, who observed that people often describe the layout of their city as it relates to \u201cmain drags\u201d or \u201ccommercial corridors.\u201d He then goes on to describe Google\u2019s unique approach to highlighting these \u201cAreas of Interest\u201d (AOI). About a year ago, these \u201cmain drags\u201d began showing up in Google Maps as clusters of orange buildings. Google communicates these \u201cAreas of Interest\u201d to its users through a specific orange shading, but with a level of detail that is truly stunning. \n\nO\u2019Beirne writes (emphasis his):\n\nThis suggests that Google took its buildings and crunched them against its places. In other words, Google appears to be creating these orange buildings by matching its building and place datasets together[.]\n\n[...]\n\nSo Google seems to be creating AOIs out of its building and place data. But what\u2019s most interesting is that Google\u2019s building and place data are themselves extracted from other Google Maps features.\n\n[...]\n\nIn other words, Google\u2019s buildings are byproducts of its Satellite/Aerial imagery. And some of Google\u2019s places are byproducts of its Street View imagery...so this makes AOIs a byproduct of byproducts. \n\nThis is bonkers, isn\u2019t it? Google is creating data out of data.\n\nThis leads O\u2019Beirne to draw some pretty interesting conclusions. If Google has mapped all the buildings and knows precisely what businesses and points of interest are located within, then perhaps the search giant can install augmented reality windshields in its self-driving cars that tell you everything you need to know about adjacent structures. As you\u2019re driving through a city \u2014 or being driven, rather \u2014 Google Maps can use its accumulated data to pinpoint buildings where you have an upcoming appointment, for example. \n\nAnother possibility is a ride-hailing service more accurate than Uber. An essay by The Verge\u2019s editor-in-chief Nilay Patel makes a cameo in O\u2019Beirne\u2019s story to highlight the difficulty faced by ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft in pinpointing exact pickup and drop-off locations. Uber and Lyft drivers already use Google Maps and Google-owned Waze in such high volumes that both ride-hail services threw up their hands and integrated Google\u2019s exceptional navigation tools into their own apps. \n\nO\u2019Beirne fails to mention Google\u2019s own ride-hail ambitions. Waymo, the self-driving division of Google parent Alphabet, is developing its own ride-hail app in anticipation of launching a commercial self-driving mobility service next year. And Waze has been piloting a car-pooling service in California for the past year. \n\nIt\u2019s clear that Google has its sights set on the lucrative ride-hailing market. And with a powerful tool like Google Maps in its arsenal, it could have its leg up over its more established players. \n",
