      "Selection": "At least a few times every week, people ask me for advice about how to think about their careers: What\u2019s the best way to get a job I care about? Should I start my own company? How can I build a career I can be proud of?\n\nAs the founder of ReWork, a recruiting firm that is all about meaningful work, I used to have ready-made answers to all these questions. I had a fairly tidy view of how career strategy should work, and I got consistent feedback that the frameworks I used were helpful to people.\n\nBut we started ReWork in 2011. And in the years since then\u2014and especially since 2015, when I left the firm to run recruiting for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign\u2014the world of work has gotten more complicated. New technologies have seeped into more and more industries and workplaces, and society is undergoing the turbulence associated with that unfolding.\n\nAt this point, instead of having answers for people who ask me for guidance, mostly I just have more questions for them. I think they\u2019re the right questions, I think they are helpful, and I think that if you sit with them, your answer for how to find meaningful work will slowly start to take shape.\n\nHow do you see your career, relative to your life?\n\nI see a career as the entire dimension of life associated with earning, professional endeavors, and vocation\u2014what you do for work. It\u2019s not the same thing as your life, but for anyone who values the world of work, it\u2019s a major slice of your life, by any measure.\n\nI\u2019m also what we might call a career optimist; I believe that our careers can be vehicles for meaning, personal growth, and community in addition to earnings and wealth. I understand that many people have dry, negative connotations to the word career\u2014perhaps seeing images of drudgery or workaholism\u2014but to me those are just attributes of non-meaningful careers. Meaningful careers are possible, if you put your attention on developing one.\n\nIt\u2019s important to periodically consider the relationship you want with work and the world of careers. There are no right or wrong answers, but if you aren\u2019t clear on this for yourself, it\u2019ll complicate all of your decisions and thinking.\n\nWhat sorts of contributions do you want to be making to the world?\n\nThe best way to start charting your course is by asking yourself, even categorically, about the ways in which you want to contribute to the world. Do you want to help make advances in science? Make beautiful art? Invent new technologies? Help shape your community via public service? Your goal should be to get increasingly specific about the types of things that you want to do.\n\nIf you can\u2019t answer this question, it will be very difficult to make plans that survive the real world, so your first move should be charting some exploratory activities that you think will help you answer it.\n\nI encourage people to think in terms of professional pursuits that they want to undertake, rather than jobs they want to \u201cget.\u201d Pursuits can look different ways. Some examples might be starting a company to solve a specific problem you care about, going on a particular adventure, contributing to society\u2019s body of knowledge on a topic that fascinates you, or working to accomplish something with a team of people you enjoy. By their nature, pursuits are multi-dimensional and involve a combination of learning things, making moves, forming alliances, and being resourceful. They are inherently more nuanced and more robust than \u201cgetting\u201d XYZ job.\n\nWhen you decide what kind of contributions you want to make, that should help focus your instinct for what types of organizations to work for or what sorts of projects you want to commit to. Keep track of the places\u2014specific companies, networks, markets\u2014that might be options for you, and make it a habit to meet people who work in those spaces and stay up to speed on their doings. Most importantly, make a list of the things that you want to learn.\n\nWhere can you learn the things you need to learn? Can you get paid to learn them?\n\nGrad school is always one option for learning about a new topic, but I also think it\u2019s usually the worst option. There are almost certainly companies or organizations that will pay you\u2014even if it\u2019s not a full private sector salary\u2014to learn deeply about a topic or industry. These days it is incredibly easy to combine active work responsibilities with a self-styled curriculum of books, articles, podcasts, and online courses.\n\nExcept for the most credentialist industries (law, medicine), I am incredibly skeptical about the value of a graduate education price tag, especially if you have to take a loan out to pay it. Every dollar you spend on education is a dollar you don\u2019t have for buying a house, making investments, or making other moves toward the lifestyle you want. So if you\u2019re going to invest in a multi-six-figure graduate degree, you\u2019d better make sure it\u2019s an investment you need to make to get where you want to go.\n\nThere are other benefits to this way of thinking (\u201cWhat can I learn here?\u201d) besides avoiding graduate school tuition. When you take a discerning approach to examining job opportunities and start asking thoughtful questions about what you are likely to learn in a given job, you become more likely to get that job, because you\u2019re showing that you\u2019re thoughtful, curious, strategic, and a learner. These are all valuable traits in today\u2019s economy.\n\nCould starting your own company be the best way to do the work that you want to do?\n\nMost people under-appreciate how strategic it can be to start a small firm (not necessarily a go-big-or-go-home startup) focused on a problem that they care about. Running a business isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s easier than most people think, and there are a ton of upsides when it comes to learning.\n\nWhen considering the sort of work you want to do, and the pursuits you want to be undertaking, make sure to include starting a company on your list. Even entrepreneurial failures can be great stepping stones in a career, if well-timed.\n\nAre you sure that you\u2019re really seeking \u201cwork-life balance\u201d?\n\nUsually what people really want when they bring up work-life balance is freedom: the freedom to choose how and when to work, and the freedom to work on the things they care about. There\u2019s no one way to get that freedom. It\u2019ll look different depending on how you\u2019re earning a living. But odds are that it\u2019s the choice of how to spend your time that you\u2019re seeking, not some specific breakdown of equal hours between \u201cwork life\u201d and \u201cpersonal life.\u201d\n\nIf you realize that you actually want freedom, then it\u2019s important to start defining the dimensions of freedom that matter most to you. Is it the ability to set your own unusual work hours? To work from home? To sometimes work remotely? To design your own projects? As the answers emerge, bring them up with your employer or possible-employers to see which pieces you can put in place.\n\nJust know that dimensions of freedom are unevenly distributed in today\u2019s economy. Degrees of freedom that some firms give everyone, others might reserve for their true all-stars who make them conditional on employment. Keep in mind that almost every employer, if getting enough value [from you, in a given role], will agree to increased degrees of freedom in order to keep getting that value. It\u2019s just a matter of how much value the firm is getting relative to which degrees of freedom you are requesting.\n\nWhat\u2019s your personal strategic practice?\n\nRegardless of your initial game plan, personality, talents, and overall career track, there is no way that you can run an effective career playbook over the long haul without revisiting these basic questions and reflecting on them with the new information that you\u2019ve gathered since the last check-in with yourself. So if you do nothing else, create a specific habit: design a practice of career reflection in which you create the strategic headspace to ask questions that matter. I recommend doing this once every month, but make sure to do it once every quarter at least. Do not wait years in-between these reflections\u2014that will make your learning unnecessarily long.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re asking yourself these questions on a regular basis, you\u2019ll make progress in the great adventure that is your career.\n\nNathaniel Koloc is SVP People at Future Laboratories, an applied research lab focused on inventing new companies, policies, and concepts to improve the quality of modern life in the United States.\n",
