They applied their tools to Bob Ross:\n\nUsing custom tools we\u2019ve built to understand large document sets, we analyzed the transcripts of all 403 episodes of Bob Ross\u2019 \u201cThe Joy of Painting\u201d to see how his famous phrases evolved over 31 seasons. That analysis, which you can read in detail, revealed the clusters shown here, which are formed by patterns in the language Ross uses when talking about each episode\u2019s painting.\n\nTags: Bob Ross, Fathom\n",
