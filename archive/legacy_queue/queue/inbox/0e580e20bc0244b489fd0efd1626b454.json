      "Selection": "Below is an analysis of the prospects in the farm system of the Chicago White Sox. Scouting reports were compiled with information provided by industry sources as well as my own observations. As there was no minor league season in 2020, there are some instances where no new information was gleaned about a player. Players whose write-ups have not been altered begin by telling you so. For the others, the blurb ends with an indication of where the player played in 2020, which in turn likely informed the changes to their report. As always, I\u2019ve leaned more heavily on sources from outside the org than within for reasons of objectivity. Because outside scouts were not allowed at the alternate sites, I\u2019ve primarily focused on data from there. Ltommyastly, in effort to more clearly indicate relievers\u2019 anticipated roles, you\u2019ll see two reliever designations, both in lists and on The Board: MIRP, or multi-inning relief pitcher, and SIRP, or single-inning relief pitcher.\n\nFor more information on the 20-80 scouting scale by which all of our prospect content is governed, you can click here. For further explanation of Future Value\u2019s merits and drawbacks, read Future Value.\n\nAll of the numbered prospects here also appear on The Board, a resource the site offers featuring sortable scouting information for every organization.

He hit .259/.394/.444 in the spring off of admittedly diluted pitching, then grinded out long, tough at-bats during the summer tune-up against a staff that would turn out to be quite good. He\u2019s also one of the more decorated college hitters ever, slashing .374/.495/.688 at Cal.\n\nHe\u2019s very likely to clear the high offensive bar at first base. He\u2019s not a great feet-and-hands athlete on the infield but Vaughn\u2019s swing is pretty athletic, and sweet. He doesn\u2019t chase and seems to have a narrow early-count approach focused on pitches he can crush. He\u2019s less able to damage well-executed breaking stuff away from him, but he often spoils those pitches or puts them in play and, again, typically doesn\u2019t offer at them until he has to. There\u2019s a clearer path to the big leagues for Vaughn now that Edwin Encarnacion and Nomar Mazara are no longer on the roster (I talk more about this in the System Overview), and he\u2019ll likely play in the big leagues in 2021. He continues to project as an All-Star first baseman. (Alternate site)\n\n55 FV Prospects\n\n2. Michael Kopech, SP\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 1st Round, 2014 from Mt.

The surgery\u2019s timing meant Kopech lost all of the 2019 regular season and began rehabbing in a game environment during Fall Instructional League. His first bolt was 99 mph. He settled in at 96-99, and threw several plus sliders. Kopech made his spring 2020 debut on March 10 and threw 11 pitches, six of which were 100 mph or more. It was his only inning of 2020, as Spring Training was shut down soon after, and Kopech would later opt out of the season amid the pandemic and other meaningful off-field considerations. As such, his evaluation is the same.\n\nKopech\u2019s trademark heat and slider give him late-inning potential even if he can\u2019t start, an outcome that seems more likely during the early part of his big league career now that he\u2019s missed two seasons and may take time to build up an innings load. He\u2019ll be able to start if he can command that slider to the back foot of left-handed hitters; he needs to have an out-pitch against lefties and some sort of viable third pitch, which I think will more likely be a second breaking ball than a split or a changeup. If he can do that, I think he\u2019s a 3-to-4 WAR starter. (At-home dev)\n\n3. Nick Madrigal, 2B\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 1st Round, 2018 from Oregon State (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n23.8\n\nHeight\n\n5\u2032 7\u2033\n\nWeight\n\n165\n\nBat / Thr\n\nR / R\n\nFV\n\n55\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n60/70\n\n35/35\n\n30/30\n\n60/60\n\n60/60\n\n50\n\nBecause he missed time with a separated shoulder (both of Madrigal\u2019s major injuries \u2014 this one and a fractured wrist in college \u2014 were suffered sliding into a base), Madrigal didn\u2019t play enough big league baseball to lose rookie eligibility, but he did play enough to generate a relevant amount of data. After posting the lowest swinging strike rate in all of the minor leagues in 2019, he had the third-lowest swinging strike rate in the big leagues in 2020 at 3.3%. The players who surround him on that leaderboard \u2014 Luis Arraez, Eric Sogard, and David Fletcher \u2014 are all similar offensive players who make elite rates of contact but have almost no power. More precisely, Madrigal is most like Arraez because of how opposite-field oriented their contact is. If you prorate Fletcher and Arraez\u2019s performance over the past few years, they\u2019re pretty well above-average players, and Madrigal is a better defensive player than Arraez and is a wash with Fletcher at second. I just think this reinforces the industry\u2019s long-standing eyeball evaluation that even though he\u2019s quite small and is not going to hit for power, Madrigal is a very good player.

Garrett Crochet, SIRP\n\nDrafted: 1st Round, 2020 from Tennessee (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n21.5\n\nHeight\n\n6\u2032 6\u2033\n\nWeight\n\n218\n\nBat / Thr\n\nL / L\n\nFV\n\n50\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nSlider\n\nChangeup\n\nCommand\n\nSits/Tops\n\n80/80\n\n65/70\n\n30/40\n\n30/40\n\n99-101 / 102\n\nCrochet spent most of his college career in the bullpen, making just one pre-draft start in 2020 after missing the first few weeks of the college season with what the Volunteers claimed was shoulder soreness. (Major league teams were skeptical of that explanation and thought his absence had to do with an off-the-field matter.) In that lone appearance this spring, Crochet threw 3.1 innings and was absolutely electric, touching 99 with his fastball while flashing a 70-grade slider. How teams valued him leading up to the draft (the relief risk, the injury or makeup issues) was highly variable. Their confidence seemed to be determined by who in the org had seen him and when (many teams weren\u2019t able to get a decision-maker to see him in person in 2020), but those that focused on his pitch data, which was shared among all the teams, thought he had among the best raw stuff in the entire draft class and was one of the few pitchers available who might pitch at the top of a rotation or in the back of a bullpen. Crochet was also among the high-octane college pitchers thought capable of going straight to the big leagues in a relief role, something more broadly considered by clubs due to the structure of the 2020 player pool. Out of Burl Carraway, Clayton Beeter, etc., only Crochet actually did.\n\nAfter he tuned up at the alternate site for about two months, Crochet was added to the 40-man and sent to the big leagues in mid-September. He pitched six innings in five relief appearances, walked no one (though he was pretty wild if you put on the tape), allowed just three hits and no runs, and struck out eight big leaguers. He made the White Sox playoff roster but left his first career postseason outing with a flexor strain, which ended his season. He\u2019s healthy now, training and throwing at the team\u2019s complex in Arizona. Because he barely threw in 2020, he\u2019s likely to be on a strict innings limit in 2021. The club is going to try to thread the needle here and use Crochet in a relief role while still trying to develop him as a long-term starter. Players in this situation tend to wind up in the bullpen, and that\u2019s where I have Crochet projected based on his strike-throwing limitations, independent of his shortened developmental timeline. (Alternate site, MLB)\n\n45 FV Prospects\n\n5. Jared Kelley, SP\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 2nd Round, 2020 from Refugio HS (TX) (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n19.2\n\nHeight\n\n6\u2032 2\u2033\n\nWeight\n\n225\n\nBat / Thr\n\nR / R\n\nFV\n\n45\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nCurveball\n\nChangeup\n\nCommand\n\nSits/Tops\n\n55/60\n\n40/45\n\n60/70\n\n25/50\n\n92-96 / 99\n\nKelley goes right at hitters with upper-90s gas and has a disappearing changeup. His curveball is occasionally average but more often is below, and as breaking ball spin is seen as an attribute a pitching prospect either has or doesn\u2019t, the ceiling on that pitch is likely limited. If the curveball, or some other breaking ball, can become average, then Kelley can be a mid-rotation starter. If not, he has late-inning relief stuff. Kelley is also a bigger, heavier kid without a modicum of positive physical projection left unless you\u2019re a proponent of \u201creverse projection,\u201d where you project on a player based on the assumption that they\u2019ll improve their conditioning in pro ball. This has happened with Forrest Whitley, Bo Bichette, and others. Even if this were to occur here, though, I\u2019m not sure it will make a difference in the area of import, which for Kelley is his breaking ball quality. (Alternate site, Fall Instructional League)\n\n40+ FV Prospects\n\n6. Zack Burdi, SIRP\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 1st Round, 2016 from Louisville (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n25.8\n\nHeight\n\n6\u2032 3\u2033\n\nWeight\n\n210\n\nBat / Thr\n\nR / R\n\nFV\n\n40+\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nSlider\n\nChangeup\n\nCommand\n\nSits/Tops\n\n65/65\n\n55/55\n\n55/55\n\n30/35\n\n96-98 / 100\n\nIt\u2019s been a long, slow ascent for Burdi after his post-surgery velocity tanked into the low-90s (he had TJ in 2017). Once parked in the 97-102 range, he was living 90-92 early on in the 2018 Fall League and was shut down with fatigue. In 2019, he was back in the 94-97 range, topping out at 99, then sat 96-99 and touched 100 during his 2020 big league debut. Burdi was knocked around in a limited major league jaunt and his velocity slowly declined (though always remained good) during that stretch. Just based on his \u2014 and perhaps unfairly, his brother\u2019s \u2014 injury history, I think the industry will always value Burdi a little lower than his talent, which is that of a late-inning reliever.\n\nIt\u2019s odd and perhaps a bit of a yellow flag that he was hit so hard in 2020, but I\u2019m still betting on the combination of velocity and two good secondary pitches and project Burdi as a third bullpen banana. His slider is short and cuttery but it\u2019s really hard, in the 88-92 mph range, and it has biting two-plane movement when it\u2019s located right. His low-90s changeup also has bat-missing tail. All three pitches are capable of missing bats, Burdi just needs to execute more consistently. During his big league action this year, I noticed he\u2019d alter his position on the rubber depending on the handedness of the opposing hitter. I don\u2019t know how long Burdi has been doing that or if it\u2019s a thing he\u2019s yet comfortable with, so perhaps he experienced a learning/feel curve in 2020. (Alternate site, MLB)\n\n7. Benyamin Bailey, RF\n\nSigned: July 2nd Period, 2018 from Panama (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n19.3\n\nHeight\n\n6\u2032 4\u2033\n\nWeight\n\n215\n\nBat / Thr\n\nR / R\n\nFV\n\n40+\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n25/50\n\n50/60\n\n20/55\n\n45/30\n\n30/45\n\n50\n\nBailey put up a ridiculous 2019 stats in the DSL, walking more than he struck out en route to a .324/.477/.454 line. He was a good bit more physical than most of his peers in that league, listed at a sturdy 6-foot-4, 215 pounds. But he was also a bit raw from a baseball standpoint though he still had success in general, and with his swing decisions in particular. He did not have the opportunity to come stateside until Fall Instructional League 2020 and his name is one of the first out of scouts\u2019 mouths when you ask them about who they liked from Chicago\u2019s Autumn group.\n\nHe has overt power projection because of his frame, though with the added strength and power comes a corner-only profile. Scouts talk about Bailey\u2019s likely eventual size as if he\u2019s going to be built like Franmil Reyes, so there\u2019s a chance he flirts with a DH-only defensive outcome. Regardless of whether he ends up in an outfield corner or without a real position, Bailey is going to have to hit. For a long-levered player who has less in-game experience than most who are the age of a college freshman, Bailey\u2019s feel for the barrel is pretty good. He\u2019s now had success against both same-aged but more experienced players in the DSL and against an Instructional League pitching pool that was unusually advanced due to a lack of minor league season. Without a valuable defensive role to fall back on, Bailey is a high-variance prospect who\u2019ll either hit enough to play every day or not. He\u2019s one of few prospects in the system who has that sort of ceiling at all and his bat-to-ball skills are better than all of the others. Were he a domestic prospect, Bailey would be the sort who goes in the third round of the draft. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n8.

He manipulates the bat head\u2019s depth and direction to get the sweet spot to pitches all over the zone. He loads his hands pretty deep, but because he\u2019s such a short-levered guy, Rodriguez is still able to catch velocity despite this. He\u2019s clearly gotten stronger and twitchier during the last year and showed up to Fall Instructional League looking more muscular and mature than in 2019. I think he\u2019s an athletic fit on the middle infield though he perhaps doesn\u2019t have quiet the arm for shortstop. That may have come with the added strength but I did not see this group in the Fall. I\u2019d like to see him be more selective, but the combination of feel to hit and defensive projection give Sanchez a shot to be a consistent, role-playing middle infielder of some kind. He has an outside shot at being a regular if he can continue to become more physical. The trajectory he\u2019s on in this regard has already surpassed what I expected after seeing him in the AZL last year. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n9.

He was assigned to Estrellas Orientales in the Dominican Winter League just before the initial publication of Chicago\u2019s list but hasn\u2019t played enough there to justify re-evaluation, so his report remains the same. Adolfo has been around for so long that even though he\u2019s missed a lot of time due to injury, we have a pretty good idea of what he is. Here\u2019s the rundown: Adolfo missed most of 2015 due to a gruesome leg fracture, broke his hamate a month into 2016, played through an elbow injury that required Tommy John in 2018, then missed most of 2019 due to arthoscopic surgery on that same elbow, before being limited to the alt site for 2020. Amid these long stretches of inactivity, Adolfo got big and buff (he nows tips the scales at a listed 255 pounds) but also pretty stiff, and while the White Sox have maintained that they\u2019d like him to play the outfield, he\u2019s one of several heavy-footed DH types on the 40-man.\n\nAdolfo has the raw power to clear that (or any) offensive bar, but he\u2019s had strikeout issues throughout his career and except for the last few injury-riddled seasons (small sample alert), he\u2019s been a hedonistic free swinger. He\u2019s run close to an 11% walk rate in his last 550 plate appearances, which is double the rate he posted from 2014 to 2017. It would give him a better chance of playing a consistent role if that increase in patience is real and sustains. The power gives Adolfo a chance to have some 2019 Jorge Soler type seasons while his whiffs make him a high variance hitter likely to have several replacement-level campaigns as well. He\u2019s in the White Sox mix for a power bench bat and occasional DH. (Alternate site, LIDOM)\n\n40 FV Prospects\n\n10.

That variability has followed him into pro ball where, even during a fairly brief instructs run in the Fall, Thompson\u2019s fastball was either up to 95 or 96, or living in the 90-92 range depending on when he was seen. (This was well after he was added to the 60-man player pool in early-August, so he\u2019d had time to get ramped up for the Fall.) Perhaps mechanical changes, aiming to simplify Thompson\u2019s delivery and make it more consistent, are at work; his delivery is super smooth but he didn\u2019t repeat it consistently as an amateur. Regardless, he remains a good long-term pitching prospect who has enough physical projection left to allow us to dream on him routinely throwing hard. He just hasn\u2019t had the opportunity to cut it loose and prove he can do it over a full season of pro starter\u2019s innings yet. His FV remains the same as last year.

That\u2019s mostly held true more than a year after he was drafted, except I saw more release point variability (as if to vary the shape of his breaking ball) and a longer arm action (which makes me less likely to project heavily on the changeup) than was described in my amateur notes. But again, Dalquist\u2019s report remains similar to last offseason\u2019s write-up. He\u2019s well-balanced over the rubber and has advanced fastball and breaking ball control. He\u2019ll likely end up with two viable breaking balls even if the changeup doesn\u2019t develop, which will be fine for thwarting lefties so long as they\u2019re located well, which they project to be. Because Dalquist is of narrow build, he doesn\u2019t have the fastball projection of most other, recently-drafted pitchers (especially since he\u2019s already 20) and projects toward the back of a rotation.

As the temperature climbed, so too did Stiever\u2019s velocity, and he started pounding the zone with 92-95, peaking at 97. In a season split between Low- and Hi-A, Stiever struck out 154 hitters and walked just 27 in 145 innings and became one of the org\u2019s better starting pitching prospects. Then he was shut down with forearm soreness toward the end of 2020\u2019s original spring training and didn\u2019t re-emerge until September, when the team called him up from the alternate site to make a few September starts, which was instructive because we got to see his velocity coming off of the forearm soreness that ended his spring. He sat 91-94, which is a little below his peak 2019 breakout when he would touch those 6\u2019s and 7\u2019s. His changeup looked better, though, and it was a stabilizing force during a jittery first start.\n\nHe\u2019ll need to locate his slider more consistently for it to be effective, and the same goes for his heater if it\u2019s going to live around 93 rather than well into the mid-90s. Stiever also incorporated his secondary stuff more often in his second outing. That\u2019s probably the long-term strategy if this is where his fastball velocity is going to live, but both his breaking ball and fastball spin were down about 200 rpm each compared to the 2019 minor league data I have. Based on his 2020 look, Stiever is a 40 FV backend starter. If he reclaims his 2019 velocity, he\u2019s a 45 FV, but that year is the one that, based on his career norms, appears to be the outlier right now. (Alternate site, MLB)\n\n13.

He is also the most reliable defensive infielder of this group and I consider him likely to stay at third base, though it\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s growing variability on both sides of that prediction, as the Sox have experimented with him at second, while one scout who saw him in the Fall think teenagers this size almost always move to first base or the outfield corners.\n\nIndeed, for his age, Ramos is already a sizable guy. Perhaps tricked by the way his fire engine red batting gloves stood out against Chicago\u2019s black and gray instructs threads, I thought he had the most explosive hands of that group, and I like how bold his stride is, even though some of his swings are reckless. Ultimately, he\u2019s a risky corner prospect a long way from the big leagues. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n14.

I wrote last year that Mercedes is built such that he looks ripped and fat at the same time, and if you\u2019ve been watching him catch for Licey in the Dominican Winter League, you can see he\u2019s begun to trend toward the latter. It doesn\u2019t matter all that much though because, anticipated rule changes or not, he can\u2019t catch, nor can he really play first base. Instead, his is a DH-only profile with serious strength, bat speed, and hand-eye coordination that might enable him to play a valuable situational role if he can overcome a propensity to chase. It\u2019s not as if the Yerm\u00ednator lacks any kind of approach. With two strikes, he ditches his huge leg kick and focuses on putting the ball in play with just his hands and wrists, and he often still hits the ball hard like this because he\u2019s so strong.\n\nPerhaps he\u2019ll have some trade value once baseball moves to a universal designated hitter but I tend to think Mercedes\u2019 epicurean sensibilities at the plate would undermine his ability to play every day. Instead, I think if he\u2019s deployed in situations where the opposing pitcher can\u2019t pitch around him and has to throw strikes, he\u2019ll be a very, very dangerous late-game hitter. How the org decides to prioritize his opportunities versus Adolfo\u2019s, Zack Collins\u2018 and others might be up to the new manager. (Alternate site, MLB (barely), LIDOM)\n\n15.

Both of their reports are unchanged. I prefer Gonzalez because I think his shorter swing enables him to make more consistent contact. He stands way off the dish, which creates some quality-of-contact limitations on pitches away from him in exchange for an ability to open up and turn on inside pitches with authority. It\u2019s an approach that\u2019s typically shiftable, but Gonzalez is also a good bunter and runs well to combat this. I think he has more big league utility than Rutherford because of these secondary skills, even though Rutherford has more power. (Alternate site)\n\n16.

Because he was only at the alt site all year, there\u2019s really no way of knowing how this has gone. I\u2019ve been watching Rutherford since his junior year of high school and he has always had a gorgeous low-ball swing that at times is suited for him slicing pitches away from him to the opposite field. I was as enamored with Rutherford\u2019s swing and big frame during his prep days as anyone, but my thinking around swings like this has changed, even if Rutherford\u2019s report hasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve never seen him really impact a ball that he hasn\u2019t gotten fully extended on, and I don\u2019t see a way of getting him to pull more without losing that that extension. Anecdotally, longer-swinged hitters seem to be better at hitting breaking balls and offspeed stuff than fastballs, and perhaps as baseball shifts toward a pitching approach that throws more breaking balls, hitters like Rutherford will actually be in a metagame position to succeed, but I\u2019m skeptical. I still think the hopeful outcome here is for a lefty platoon bat. (Alternate site)\n\n17.

It meant having to scrutinize, and perhaps dismiss, Sanchez\u2019 strong .297/.386/.441 line, while his underlying TrackMan data (a major league-average 88 mph mean exit velo, with only 25% of balls in play hit over 95 mph) reinforced the international scouting opinion that Sanchez is probably more of a utility player than a potential everyday guy due to a lack of power. The Fall Instructional League look in 2020, Sanchez\u2019s first stateside action, was similar, though he has been strength training in Miami and is getting pretty big. We won\u2019t know if that has yielded stock-boosting power in games until he hopefully faces age-appropriate competition in 2021. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n18.

In the Fall of 2020, he was also throwing harder: up from 89-92 and touching 94 in 2019, McClure was suddenly sitting 92-95 with a host of viable secondary pitches. He looks like a near-ready depth option and perhaps more if his velocity keeps climbing. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n19.

He had two high-end contact seasons as a 17 and 18-year old in rookie ball (one aided by the Pioneer League\u2019s hitting environment), then had a dud of a 2019 at age 19, then only saw instructs action this Fall. He\u2019ll still be fairly young for Hi-A in 2021. I think he\u2019ll ultimately be the sort of infielder who is only able to play second or third because of good positioning, but I\u2019m interested in seeing what happens to the power output if Sosa trains and tries to hit with that in mind.

He\u2019s going to strike out a lot, so much that it will be detrimental to his offensive output relative to the average big leaguer, but that\u2019s true of a lot of backup catchers. Zavala is a viable defensive catcher with above-average raw power, and I think he\u2019d run into as many as 10 homers as a full-season backup. Where he sits amidst a crowded catching situation in Chicago depends on how the org views Mercedes and Collins defensively. He\u2019s likely the third catcher during his option years and someone\u2019s backup once those expire. (Alternate site)\n\n21.

At the same time, this is the sort of player who the year away from seeing pro pitching probably hurts the most, and the kind of player who a shorter draft and a more limited number of minor league roster spots will also hurt. As a hitter, Beard is more like a five o\u2019clock shadow, one of the least-experienced bats to appear on a team\u2019s list this year. But of all the young hitters in this org, he has the greatest chance of staying up the middle because his speed almost guarantees he\u2019ll stay in center field forever. He\u2019s a half-decade dev project with the speed to be a leadoff pest. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n22.

Because Johnson was hurt for most of the pre-deadline part of the 2019 season he wasn\u2019t widely seen until the Fall League, where he struggled to throw strikes. He is athletically built but doesn\u2019t have an athletic delivery. He has a very casual, very terse stride that cuts him off and forces him to throw across his body. It\u2019s weird and disorienting the first few times you see it, which makes the 93-95 fastballs Johnson throws catch you off guard. He\u2019ll flash a plus breaking ball, but that was also inconsistent in Fall. He\u2019s a 40 FV from a stuff and deception perspective, though industry feedback (the AFL look was bad) mostly had him in the tier beneath this one. (Alternate site)\n\n23.

He does have good bat control and makes mid-flight adjustments to breaking balls, which he has the raw strength to punish even if the timing of his lower half has been compromised. He\u2019s a good hitter, just one I\u2019m skeptical will clear the offensive bar at first base without trading some contact for power, which hasn\u2019t happened yet. He got some run in the outfield during Instructional League, and if he proves capable of playing there then he belongs up in the Gonzalez/Rutherford area. If you stand back and take a bird\u2019s eye view of the profile, this is a 24-year-old who hasn\u2019t slugged over .415 in pro ball yet and now occupies a 40-man spot on a club that has several other hitters just like him.

He was a 2020 non-roster invitee but blew out and needed Tommy John in February, missing the entire season. And yet there was some light industry buzz that he was being talked about as a Rule 5 Draft sleeper because Schyver\u2019s pitch data is superlative in a specific way. Namely, his release point is really, really high (top 20 among minor league lefties in 2019) and yet, because he doesn\u2019t take much of a stride down the mound, his extension is just a shade over five feet, which is very low. His release point is unique due to this combination, and it creates really weird angle on his fastball, which spins a lot relative to its velocity. Conversely, his slider has almost no spin. It\u2019s weird. He\u2019s a sleeper who I expect will be at least an up/down option year reliever. (Injury)\n\n25.

He sat 92-95 and touched 97 in rookie ball and flashed a plus breaking ball. The pandemic made it tough for pro dev take-a-leap guys everywhere to break out. Freeman was working with two different breaking balls in the Fall, but he was a little wild again and he may always be, as his arm action is long.

He has a bad approach that limits both the quality and amount of contact he makes.

The cause? A slight uptick in velocity paired with an arm slot change that has him coming straight over the top, creating more life on his heater; it also creates more vertical action on his breaking stuff. This delivery appears tough to maintain, as Lambert has to contort his body to get to that slot, but he hasn\u2019t been wild since making the change. In 2019, he tore his UCL and needed Tommy John in June. I assumed that would cost him all of 2020, but he went to the Sox alternate site and actually made his big league debut in July of 2020. After just two outings, though, he was again shut down with a forearm strain and put on the 60-day IL. (For The Board, I\u2019m using pitch data I have from 2019 rather than what he generated in a two-inning, perhaps somewhat injured big league sample in 2020.) I still have him projected in an up/down relief role eventually. (Alternate site, MLB)\n\n28. Bailey Horn, MIRP\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 5th Round, 2020 from Auburn (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n22.9\n\nHeight\n\n6\u2032 2\u2033\n\nWeight\n\n217\n\nBat / Thr\n\nL / L\n\nFV\n\n35+\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nFastball\n\nSlider\n\nCurveball\n\nCommand\n\nSits/Tops\n\n50/50\n\n50/50\n\n50/55\n\n40/45\n\n90-93 / 96\n\nMy notes on Horn\u2019s Fall exploits aren\u2019t great; a scout told me his fastball was very hittable in the outing they saw. But he had been a consistent \u201carrow-up\u201d prospect throughout the previous year and a half. He had surgery while at junior college then pitched out of the Auburn bullpen as a draft-eligible sophomore, and his velo climbed the further away from the surgery he got. Horn won a rotation spot in the Fall of 2019 then came out touching 96 as a junior and had four really good starts before the shut down. He\u2019s another up/down relief prospect with two quality breaking balls and could probably stand to use the curveball as a strike-one pitch more than he did in college. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n29. Bryce Bush, RF\n\nDrafted: 33rd Round, 2018 from De La Salle Collegiate HS (MI) (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n21.0\n\nHeight\n\n6\u2032 0\u2033\n\nWeight\n\n200\n\nBat / Thr\n\nR / R\n\nFV\n\n35+\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n30/35\n\n55/60\n\n35/55\n\n50/45\n\n30/35\n\n50\n\nA late-round, cold-weather high school flier who signed for $290,000, Bush played in some of the big prep showcases during his final amateur summer and was clearly overmatched against the better pitching. But he put on an absolute show during batting practice and has one of the best raw power projections among potential future Sox. He had a strong pro debut on paper and continued to look good with the bat during the spring of 2019, then struggled during the summer. The general scouting consensus is that Bush will not stay at his current third base and will have to move to an outfield corner or to first, which immediately makes his whiffs troublesome. He\u2019s a high-risk, long-term developmental prospect with some of the louder offensive tools in the system. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n30. DJ Gladney, 3B\n\nDrafted: 16th Round, 2019 from Illiana Christian HS (IL) (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n19.4\n\nHeight\n\n6\u2032 3\u2033\n\nWeight\n\n200\n\nBat / Thr\n\nR / R\n\nFV\n\n35+\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n20/40\n\n50/60\n\n25/55\n\n40/40\n\n30/40\n\n50\n\nI reposting last year\u2019s comment because I still think it\u2019s relevant: Gladney presents an interesting case for splitting actual age away from other Traits of Maturity in draft models, since he was young for the class in both age and reps (another possible Trait of Maturity), but not physically (a third). He\u2019s a strong guy who strides way open as he tries to pull everything with power, an all-or-nothing approach. Like Bryce Bush before him, Gladney will be tried at third base for a while but may not stay there. He\u2019s a high risk corner power prospect. (Fall Instructional League)\n\n31. Luis Mieses, CF\n\nVideo\n\nSigned: July 2nd Period, 2016 from Dominican Republic (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n20.6\n\nHeight\n\n6\u2032 3\u2033\n\nWeight\n\n210\n\nBat / Thr\n\nL / L\n\nFV\n\n35+\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n30/55\n\n50/55\n\n20/50\n\n45/40\n\n45/45\n\n45\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s damning that Mieses was not invited to receive fall instruction in the U.S. but since I have no new information here, good or bad, he remains at the back of the list as a huge-framed young player with rare feel for contact for such a long-limbed hitter. Like others in the system, his approach is bad and could be his undoing. (At-home dev)\n\n32. Jake Burger, 1B\n\nVideo\n\nDrafted: 1st Round, 2017 from Missouri State (CHW)\n\nAge\n\n24.7\n\nHeight\n\n6\u2032 2\u2033\n\nWeight\n\n210\n\nBat / Thr\n\nR / R\n\nFV\n\n35+\n\nTool Grades (Present/Future)\n\nHit\n\nRaw Power\n\nGame Power\n\nRun\n\nFielding\n\nThrow\n\n35/50\n\n60/60\n\n40/55\n\n30/30\n\n40/45\n\n60\n\nBecause of the pandemic, Burger was facing a third consecutive season without regular reps following two lost to a myriad of severe heel injuries (including two Achilles ruptures) and instead played for the Normal CornBelters in a makeshift league put together after COVID squashed the usual summer wood bat festivities in the Midwest. Burger\u2019s play and Chicago\u2019s late-summer 60-man pool space enabled them to roster him at the alternate site toward the end of the season before he went to instructs in the Fall.\n\nHe\u2019s leaner and more mobile than scouts anticipated, evidence of the work he put in during his unthinkable series of misfortunes. The Sox added him to the 40-man in November. While his story of perseverance is remarkable, and all of baseball is rooting for the guy, who seems like an affable and funny young man, he\u2019s unlikely to make a long-term big league impact. I was on the low end of projecting Burger while he was in college, skeptical of his ability to play third even before all the injuries. Now, his swing path is also a bit of an issue. He should be given an opportunity to claim that bench power bat spot but I think others in the org are more likely to do so. (CarShield Collegiate League, alternate site, Fall Instructional League)\n\nOther Prospects of Note\n\nCatching Depth (and Remillard)\nCarlos Perez, C\nGunnar Troutwine, C\nRicardo Aguilar, C\nZach Remillard, SS\n\nPerez, 23, has good bat-to-ball skills and arm strength but little power. He might be a third catcher. Troutwine is a tough dude with great feel for the strike zone. Aguilar just signed. He\u2019s a converted infielder with a compact frame and contact-oriented approach. Remillard is upper-level depth capable of playing almost every position on the field.\n\nHigh Probability Depth Arms\nKonnor Pilkington, LHP\nAndrew Perez, LHP\nVince Arobio, RHP\nBernardo Flores Jr., LHP\n\nAll of these pitchers are in their mid-20s. Pilkington is an SEC college performance prospect with below average stuff. He\u2019s a sixth starter type. Perez needs to find a breaking ball, but he will touch 95 from the left side and his changeup is plus. Arobio has a high spin, backspinning fastball, too, but his angle is more downhill. He has the best breaking ball of this group. Flores is a four-pitch lefty with good breaking stuff and a 40 fastball.\n\nYounger, Raw Pitching\nFrander Veras, RHP\nDavis Martin, RHP\nYoelvin Silven, RHP\nMcKinley Moore, RHP\nAdisyn Coffey, RHP/3B\nRonaldo Guzman, LHP\n\nVeras is 21 and spent 2019, his first pro season, in the DSL. He was up to 96 there and his changeup has late sinking action at times. Martin is another good Day 3 pick out of Texas Tech. He sits 89-94 and has a plus slider. Silven was up to 95 as a 19-year-old in 2019, and sitting 93 and touching 96 late in 2020. His secondary stuff is below average and the Sox are tinkering with a couple different breaking balls there. Moore is an arm strength-only prospect who actually threw strikes pretty consistently during instructs, which he needs to continue doing as he climbs the ladder. He\u2019s up to 98. Coffey was the team\u2019s underslot 2020 signee so they could fit Kelley into their bonus pool. He was a high school infielder once committed to ASU, ended up at a Midwest JUCO and moved to the mound. He\u2019s been 93-95 in spurts but had a Tommy John two months ago and is now taking BP and groundballs. Guzman is a small-ish 18-year-old lefty who was the youngest player on the Instructional League roster. He struck out a lot of DSL hitters in 2019 even though he only threw in the mid-80s because his fastball has big carry. He\u2019s now into the upper-80s and will have an impact fastball if he can keep throwing harder.\n\nSystem Overview\n\nThe White Sox have graduated top prospects several years running, and their 2020 group was particularly strong. Especially now that they\u2019re pushing in their chips and trading prospects for current big leaguers (Dane Dunning would have been in the 50 FV tier, while Avery Weems would be toward the top of the 40s), this group is starting to thin a little bit, and this list may be artificially deep because I\u2019ve kept some of the young hellion hitting prospects alive here. It\u2019s likely a couple of the toolsy scratch-offs toward the bottom of the list would have struggled during a 2020 season and fallen off, but it\u2019s also possible one or two of them would have broken out in a meaningful way, although I suppose Bailey did during the Fall and that stretch also reinforced the notion that Rodriguez might have a special bat. It\u2019s especially important to this org that the draft be as many rounds as the owners can stomach to fill in some depth at the bottom of the system.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that even the really good prospects in this system have very aggressive approaches, often so aggressive that it undermines their ability to hit. I think virtual reality training would be an interesting fit for this org. The concept of it makes sense: show your hitters dozens of pitches per day, from VR big league pitching, and try to develop pitch recognition skills without needing to have a pitcher there. Some orgs have tried it and seen promising early results but the pandemic wiped out another season to evaluate if it was working.\n\nThe White Sox did not appear to opt in to Fall data sharing with the rest of baseball, as I asked multiple sources to check on some objective information for this list and they found nothing from instructs in their system. Because this is one of the orgs I did not see myself in the Fall, alterations to this list were largely derived from the opinions of scouts I spoke to who saw ball at Camelback Ranch and whatever was gleaned from players\u2019 big league performance.\n",
