      "Selection": "As you all know, I\u2019m fond of financial scorecards. While admitting their limitations, I like numbers and tools that allow you to compare your financial progress with other people.\n\nI like credit scores, for instance, because they put a number on how you handle money \u2014 a number you can compare to Americans at large. And I like apps like Credit Sesame, which let you to monitor your credit score \u2014 much like a bathroom scale lets you monitor your weight.\n\nPerhaps my favorite number is net worth, the total value of everything you own. Calculating net worth is easy. It\u2019s what you own minus what you owe. That\u2019s it. Simple, right? Simple but powerful.\n\nNet worth tracks your financial health in the same way that weight measures your fitness. Neither number tells the whole story, but as a measure of change over time each is a handy tool.\n\nWant to calculate your own net worth? I\u2019ve created this free net worth spreadsheet in Google Docs for you to download or copy. It\u2019s still branded with Money Boss, but I\u2019ll change that soon.\n\nNet worth is a great way to track your own financial progress as you age. But have you ever wished you could compare your net worth with the net worth of other Americans? I have. It\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s a complicated process that required digging through tables of government data.\n\nWell, Zach at Four Pillar Freedom \u2014 who must have too much free time \u2014 recently took info from the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances and created a couple of tools that let you visualize the net worth of Americans by age. These tools aren\u2019t sophisticated. They perform simple tasks, but they perform them well.\n\nHere, for instance, is Zach\u2019s tool for looking at net worth percentiles by age.\n\nMy net worth of approximately $1.6 million puts me between the 95th and 96th percentile of Americans aged 45-49.\n\nZach also whipped up a quick chart to show the number of people who have positive net worths versus those with negative net worths. Plus he has a quick tool that compares the median net worth for each age group to the net worth of the top 1% in each population.\n\nIf you too are a money nerd who likes to compare yourself to others, then take a few minutes to explore Zach\u2019s net worth visualizer!\n\nThe post Visualizing your net worth \u2014 and how it compares to others appeared first on Get Rich Slowly.\n",
