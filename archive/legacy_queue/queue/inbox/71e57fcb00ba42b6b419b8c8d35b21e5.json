      "Title": "A Giant Among Giants",
      "Selection": "\n  What the IPO filing did not make clear was just how Glencore, founded four decades ago by Marc Rich, a defiant friend of dictators and spies who later became one of the world\u2019s richest fugitives, achieved this kind of global dominance. The answer \u2014 pieced together for this article over a year of reporting that included numerous interviews with past and current Glencore employees and a review of leaked corporate records, dossiers prepared by private investigative firms, court documents, and various international investigations \u2014 is at once simpler and far more complicated than it appears. Like all traders, Glencore makes its money at the margins, but Glencore, even more so than its competitors, profits by working in the globe\u2019s most marginal business regions and often, investigators have found, at the margins of what is legal.\n",
