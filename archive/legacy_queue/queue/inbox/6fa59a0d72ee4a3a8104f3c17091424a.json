      "Title": "The UN Security Council passed a resolution to end Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories Quartz",
      "Selection": "Late today (Dec. 23), the United Nations Security Council voted on a resolution to end Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories. Fourteen of 15 council members were in agreement\u2014only the US abstained. Applause broke out in the room after the draft resolution passed.\n\nInitially proposed by Egypt and withdrawn under pressure from Israel and US president-elect Donald Trump, the resolution was put forward for a vote this afternoon by New Zealand, Malaysia, Venezuela and Senegal. It states that Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, have \u201cno legal validity\u201d and demanded a halt to \u201call Israeli settlement activities.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s permanent representative at the UN, Danny Danon, denounced the resolution and those who voted for it, asking the room full of Security Council members afterward, \u201cWould you ban the French from building in Paris?\u201d\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s Prime Minister, also minced no words in a statement issued in response to the vote, and signaled that the more things change, the more they stay the same. \u201cIsrael rejects this shameful anti-Israel resolution at the UN and will not abide by its terms,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Palestinians, the resolution\u2019s passage is at least a symbolic win, whatever Netanyahu and others threaten. \u201cThis is a day of victory for international law, a victory for civilized language and negotiation and a total rejection of extremist forces in Israel,\u201d said chief Palestinian Authority peace negotiator Saeb Erekat in a statement.\n\nWe express our gratitude to the cosponsors of #UNSC 2334 on illegal Israeli settlements @NZUN @venezuela_un @MalaysiaMFA #Senegalhttp://pic.twitter.com/0va9e7jLFf\n\n\u2014 Palestine PLO \u2013 NAD (@nadplo) December 23, 2016\n\nThe US has avoided referring to the Israeli settlement activity as \u201cillegal\u201d as a concession to Israel, which hopes to incorporate larger settlement blocs if a two-state solution with the Palestinians is reached. Today\u2019s resolution, explicitly stating that settlement is illegal, is an international rebuke from other nations, rejecting that American circumspection and Israel\u2019s actions though it imposes no sanctions. To reverse the vote that passed today, a follow-up vote must be proposed\u2014but that proposal needs to survive the veto power of the Britain, China, France, or Russia, which seems unlikely given the enthusiasm for today\u2019s resolution.\n\nIt was President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to abstain from the UN vote today, and the abstention is in accord with Obama\u2019s chilly relationship with Netanyahu and the Israeli right wing.\n\nOn the other hand, president-elect Trump is very much in alignment with the current Israeli prime minister, and had urged the US to veto this resolution before it went up for vote. Trump\u2019s pick for Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, is hawkish and opposes the two-state solution for peace\u2014which is the ultimate goal of today\u2019s UN Security Council resolution.\n\nConstruction of Israeli settlements undermines efforts to reach peace by signaling Israel\u2019s intent to continue expanding. Halting settlements would ostensibly increase the Palestinians\u2019 faith in Israel\u2019s seriousness about the peace process and about giving back occupied land.\n\nAfter the vote, Trump tweeted that things will be different at the UN once he\u2019s in office. But \u201cdifferent\u201d is a pretty vague goal and the businessman has never had to contend with Middle East politics for real.\n\nAs to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.\n\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016\n\nBluster has gotten him far. But the tricky question of peace for Israel and Palestine has stumped the world\u2019s greatest minds and its finest leaders for decades.\n",
