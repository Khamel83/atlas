      "Selection": "Increased welcome bonuses on popular travel rewards credit cards are a great way to earn a quick infusion of points or miles, and\u00a0The Business Platinum\u00ae Card from American Express OPEN is currently offering just that, with a welcome bonus of\u00a0up to 100,000 points. It\u2019s also relatively common to see similar offers on the personal\u00a0Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express through the CardMatch tool. If you\u2019ve recently received (or are working towards) this welcome bonus, keep reading! Today I\u2019ll go through some of the best ways to redeem your 100,000 Membership Rewards points.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the following redemptions all involve transferring your points to one of the program\u2019s 17 airline partners or 2 hotel partners, as this is typically the best way to redeem your Membership Rewards for maximum value. While you can use points directly for travel through the Amex Travel site, this generally won\u2019t get you as much value as you\u2019ll get through partner programs. While transferring does involve extra steps and you\u2019re subject to some variable transfer times, it\u2019s often worth the effort.\n\nIn addition, the Membership Rewards program requires you to link your various frequent flyer accounts with your Membership Rewards account before you initiate a transfer. Here\u2019s how to do this:\n\nLogin to your account at americanexpress.com.\n\nClick on your Membership Rewards-earning card (if necessary), then click on Explore Rewards\n\nClick on the Transfer Points option, then click View All\n\nClick on the partner whose account you want to link\n\nSelect a card holder, verify your card details, enter the corresponding program\u2019s account number, then click Link Account\n\nFrom there you\u2019ll receive a confirmation that the link was successful and will be redirected to the Transfer Points page to complete the transaction:\n\nHowever, be sure you\u2019ve checked award availability before transferring, since you can\u2019t change your mind after the fact. Once a transfer has been initiated, it\u2019s final!\n\nAnother note: you\u2019ll need to pay a small fee whenever you transfer points into a US program like Delta SkyMiles or JetBlue TrueBlue, which will offset the federal excise tax that American Express must pay when you transfer points. But don\u2019t be alarmed; it\u2019s only $0.0006 (or six hundredths of 1 cent) per point and is capped at $99. You\u2019re even given the option to use points to cover the expense, but I strongly encourage you to just pay for it, as you\u2019ll only get a redemption value of 0.5 cents per point.\n\nSo with those details out of the way, what are some of the best ways to use 100,000 points?\n\n1. Up to Four Round-Trip Economy Flights to Hawaii\n\nIf Hawaii is on your list of dream destinations, the Membership Rewards program has you covered.\n\nThe first option is a popular one for many travelers: booking award flights to Hawaii. The Aloha State isn\u2019t always easy to reach using points or miles, but the Membership Rewards program gives you a few great options. The first is for West Coast residents. By transferring points to British Airways, you can utilize the carrier\u2019s distance-based award chart to book round-trip award flights to the islands for just 25,000 Avios. The gateways that fall within this band include nonstop flights from Los Angeles (LAX) and Phoenix (PHX) on American as well as nonstop flights from Seattle (SEA), Portland (PDX), San Diego (SAN), Oakland (OAK) and even Bellingham, Washington (BLI) on Alaska Airlines. Just be aware that you must call to redeem your Avios on Alaska-operated flights, and you may currently need to call for American ones as well, especially if you don\u2019t want to utilize this irritating workaround.\n\nIf you don\u2019t live on the West Coast, don\u2019t fret! You can still get to Hawaii by transferring your Membership Rewards points to Air France/KLM\u2019s Flying Blue program and redeeming them on Delta-operated flights. Flying Blue recently revamped its program and award prices are all over the map, so it\u2019s impossible to predict exactly what awards will cost when redeeming this way. But we\u2019ve found economy flights from New York (JFK) to Hawaii for as low as 35,000 miles round-trip, so it\u2019s definitely an option under the right circumstances.\u00a0Just be sure to check availability beforehand, as Delta doesn\u2019t always release a ton of award seats.\n\n2. Round-Trip Business Class Ticket to Japan\n\nA round-trip ticket to Japan from the US is within your reach with 100,000 Membership Rewards points.\n\nIf you\u2019d rather cross the entire Pacific Ocean and do so in style, consider transferring your Membership Rewards points to Virgin Atlantic. The London-based carrier isn\u2019t part of a major alliance, instead partnering with various airlines and releasing different redemption schemes for each. But one of the more lucrative ones is on ANA. For just 90,000 miles, you can fly round-trip from Canada or the western US to Japan in business class. The price is just slightly higher (95,000 miles) for the central and eastern US, which includes New York and Washington, DC (IAD), and also applies to flights from Europe.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s critical to note that you can\u2019t book one-way award tickets on ANA through Flying Club, so you must find round-trip availability. This is where ExpertFlyer can come in handy, as you can set alerts for a variety of dates and then call to book as soon as you\u2019re notified that seats have opened up.\n\n3. Up to Three Round-Trip Tickets to Spain\n\nIberia business class is a great option for your 100,000 Membership Rewards points, though you could get up to three round-trip economy flights as well!\n\nAnother lucrative transfer partner of the Membership Rewards program is Iberia. Like British Airways (its corporate cousin), the carrier uses Avios as its currency and follows a distance-based award chart. However, for flights on its own metal, you aren\u2019t subject to the horrendous taxes and fees that you\u2019d pay booking through British Airways.\n\nOne sweet spot is for East Coast residents: a round-trip, off-peak economy award ticket from either New York or Boston (BOS) to Madrid (MAD) would set you back just 34,000 Avios, which means you\u2019d be able to get three of these award tickets with your haul of points.\u00a0(Yes, that would technically be 102,000 Membership Rewards points. However, since you\u2019d need to spend some money to earn the welcome bonus on either the personal or business Amex Platinum, I\u2019m comfortable including it.)\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to fly to Madrid from Miami (MIA), Chicago (ORD) or even Los Angeles (LAX), you can actually score round-trip economy award tickets for just 42,500 miles apiece, so you and a friend or spouse can get to Spain in this fashion. And if you\u2019re feeling like traveling in style, a round-trip business class award ticket from these gateways to Madrid will be just 85,000 Avios. That\u2019s a steal for transatlantic business class!\n\n4. Up to 25 One-Way Short-Haul Flights\n\nEarlier I noted a \u201csweet spot\u201d redemption by transferring your Membership Rewards points to British Airways and redeeming them through the carrier\u2019s distance-based award chart to get from the West Coast to Hawaii. While 25,000 Avios for that round-trip ticket can be a great value, you can also get tremendous value by looking at short haul flights.\n\nThrough the Executive Club program, British Airways or partner flights outside of North America that cover less than 651 miles in length are just 4,500 Avios apiece. In addition, if you book on the carrier\u2019s own metal or that of Iberia or Aer Lingus and travel on off-peak dates, you\u2019d only need 4,000 Avios!\u00a0This can be a terrific redemption out of Oneworld hub airports, as these flights can be quite expensive (though be sure to check the cost of a paid ticket to make sure you\u2019re getting a good value).\n\nAs an example or how far this can take you, here\u2019s a map that shows the destinations within 651 miles of Tokyo (NRT), one of Japan Airlines\u2019 main hubs:\n\nAs you can see, you could take virtually any flight within Japan and pay just 4,500 Avios each way!\n\nIn addition, you can take flights that are 1,151 miles or less in distance for just 7,500 Avios in each direction, giving you the option of booking six of these round-trip tickets with the Membership Rewards points you\u2019d earn from the Amex Business Platinum.\n\n5. Round-Trip Business Class (or Maybe Even First) to Europe or Southern South America\n\nAnother transfer partner of American Express Membership Rewards is Etihad Guest. While you likely won\u2019t get much value transferring your points to Etihad and redeeming for flights on its own metal, there are some terrific redemption options on partner airlines. One of my favorites involves American \u2014 if you can find availability to either Europe or Southern South America (including Argentina, Chile and most of Brazil), you can book a round-trip flight for just 100,000 Etihad Guest miles. American would charge 115,000 AAdvantage miles for the same award.\n\nIn addition, reports indicate that Etihad applies the same pricing on these flights for both business and first class, so if you can find a seat in the \u201cZ\u201d fare class (American\u2019s saver level first class inventory) on any of these routes, you should be able to book it for just 50,000 Etihad Guest miles each way. The only potential drawback is that you must call to book these, but the same story linked above has complete details on Etihad\u2019s new-and-improved Serbian call center.\n\n100,000 miles for round-trip, long-haul business class is quite good. Getting that exact same price for first class is truly spectacular.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Amex Business Platinum card\u2019s welcome bonus is a great way to unlock incredible redemptions.\n\nThe Membership Rewards program can give its members a ton of value, especially when you utilize its diverse set of transfer partners. By transferring your points to these airlines, you can extend their value far beyond the 1 cent per point that you can get for booking flights directly. If you\u2019re set to score 100,000 points from either the Business Platinum\u00a0card or the personal Platinum card, hopefully this post has given you some inspiration to start planning your next trip.\n",
