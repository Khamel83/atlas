      "Title": "Please don\u2019t bribe the officials Singapore\u2019s Chinese embassy has some etiquette rules for mainland tourists Quartz",
      "Selection": "Chinese tourists have the reputation they do for a reason.\n\nTheir antics and outlandish behavior\u2014such as the case of a teenager defacing an Egyptian pyramid in 2013\u2014have become well-documented in news and social media, and China knows such acts reflect poorly on the country. To preempt further damage, Chinese embassy officials in Singapore have published a 27-page pamphlet for mainland tourists with travel guidelines and etiquette. Among the advice it offers: \u201cDon\u2019t try to bribe custom officials when you are rejected entry with a valid visa.\u201d\n\nNearly 6 million people from China are expected to travel abroad during the 68th National Day holiday, a week-long break known as Golden Week that kicks off Sunday (Oct. 1). In anticipation of this, the new booklet details accepted behavior and rules of conduct in the city-state, which received nearly 2 million Chinese tourists in the first seven months of 2017, according to Singapore\u2019s tourism board.\n\nTop international travel destinations during the 2017 National Day Holiday, according to China\u2019s travel agency Ctrip. (Quartz)\n\nThe first copies of the pamphlet, titled \u201cSafe and Civilized Travel for Chinese Citizens in the Lion City,\u201d were given to 20 Chinese tourists on Sept. 22 shortly after they arrived in Changi Airport, having agreed to partake in a press conference held by the embassy. The 10-chapter guide (link in Chinese) covers more than a hundred \u201cdos and don\u2019ts.\u201d\n\nHere are some of the dos:\n\nReach out to the airline staff if you feel disturbed by other passengers. Don\u2019t get into a fight.\n\nGive a proper tip\u2014in cash\u2014to the hotel porter who helps carry luggage to your room.\n\nGive precedence to others when taking photos at tourist sites. Don\u2019t fight for spots or hinder others when they are taking pictures. Please say thank you when asking others for help taking a photo.\n\nDress clean and proper. Although the weather in Singapore is hot, don\u2019t reveal the chest and bare arms.\n\nAsk for permission if you don\u2019t have time and wish to jump the queue.\n\nAnd some of the don\u2019ts:\n\nDon\u2019t take the life vests and blankets off the plane.\n\nDon\u2019t bring durian (a fruit known for its strong odor) on public transportation.\n\nDon\u2019t take the ashtray or bath towels from guest rooms.\n\nDon\u2019t use towels or bed sheets to wipe your shoes. Use the hotel\u2019s facilities properly, and follow the rules for its swimming pool.\n\nDon\u2019t evade bus fare.\n\nThese suggestions come following a series of uncouth Chinese visitor behavior in recent years. In 2014, for example, four mainland tourists threw hot water and noodles at a flight attendant because their group wasn\u2019t seated together on a flight from Bangkok to Nanjing, China, forcing the plane to turn back. In 2013, a tour group of 30 lifted stainless-steel cutlery from a Singapore Airlines plane and refused to return them until the group\u2019s tour guide said the act was \u201churting the reputation of Chinese people.\u201d\n\nThe latest pamphlet is in line with travel guidelines issued by Chinese officials. In 2013, China\u2019s national tourism administration issued a 64-page booklet titled \u201cGuidebook for Civilized Tourism,\u201d following an earlier one-page version in 2006, which contained rules such as: Don\u2019t sneeze at others, and don\u2019t force foreigners to take group photos (link in Chinese).\n\nMost Popular\n",
