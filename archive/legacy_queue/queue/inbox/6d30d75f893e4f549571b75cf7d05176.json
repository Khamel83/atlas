      "Selection": "Are people who prefer their steaks well done just wrong? It\u2019s the question that has divided a nation that is otherwise firmly united on the \u201csteak is great\u201d front, given that we Americans consume about 25 billion pounds of beef annually. It makes ordering at steakhouses for large parties a negotiation; it causes effete elitists like me to reconsider the measure of a diner; and I\u2019m going to guess that the BTUs of gas spent taking perfectly good rare steaks to well done amount to an environmental catastrophe.\n\nA May 2014 investigation from this very website \u2014 one which, by my own admission, began as a campaign to smear those who enjoyed well-done beef \u2014 found that when people self-reported their steak preferences, most said medium-rare, followed by medium and then medium-well.\n\nBut that\u2019s just what people say they like. We\u2019re living in a society where meat doneness preference has been used as a political cudgel against the holder of the highest office in the U.S. We have to get to the tender, marbled meat of the issue.\n\nLonghorn Steakhouse hooked us up here, agreeing to share aggregated data about how Americans prefer their steak. Longhorn shared a year\u2019s worth of steak orders1 from all of its 491 U.S. locations, revealing how Americans ordered all different cuts of steak. It turns out that Americans claim to like their steak a lot rarer than they actually do!2\n\nThere are serious differences in how people order different cuts, and we wanted to know why.\n\n\u201cEvery steak has a different fiber,\u201d said Jens Dahlmann, the executive chef at Longhorn. \u201cIf you look at the most tender steak, it\u2019s the tenderloin. That\u2019s a steak that lends itself to barely cooking it. It\u2019s got a very soft fiber and very sweet flavors to it. It works great for rare and medium-rare.\u201d\n\nPrime rib also works great on the rarer side. Because it\u2019s cooked slowly and at low temperatures, a rare order of prime rib can come out without the bloodiness that turns off many rare-averse people. Other steaks can handle more heat.\n\n\u201cSteaks that still perform very well even if you go to a medium-well temperature, those would be the highly marbled steaks, the ribeye, even the porterhouse or T-bone,\u201d Dahlmann said. \u201cThere is a bone running through the middle, and around the bone retains more moisture and flavor.\u201d\n\nDavid Berson, director of operations at Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn, agreed. \u201cSome people like a ribeye rare, but I would recommend cooking it a little longer. It\u2019s got a lot of fat.\u201d\n\nOne way cooks can get a leg up is to buy thicker cuts of beef, which gives them more margin for error than the thin cuts most supermarkets sell. \u201cFor home cooks it\u2019s important to get the highest quality they can,\u201d Berson said. \u201cWith protein \u2014 fish, beef \u2014 you don\u2019t want to cut corners.\u201d\n\nMeat buying is a big part of the job at Luger\u2019s. \u201cWe look for fat distribution or marbling,\u201d Berson said. \u201cThat\u2019ll be a good indication of how juicy the steaks will be.\u201d\n\nDahlmann suggests that home cooks invest in a high-quality meat thermometer to nail the perfect doneness every time. Any steak with an internal temperature from 95 degrees to 105 degrees Fahrenheit is rare, anything from 115 to 125 degrees is medium-rare and, according to FiveThirtyEight culture writer and cantankerous elitist Walt Hickey, anything above that is ruined.\n",
