      "Title": "Satisfy Your Inner Child and Adult With Gorgeous Disney Posters for Grown-Ups WIRED",
      "Selection": "From kids sleuthing around pretending to be the Great Mouse Detective to Elsa wannabes singing \u201cLet It Go\u201d until their parents inadvertently memorize the lyrics, every generation has its Disney fans. But as they get older, it becomes harder for adult die-hards to find a poster for their favorite Mouse House flick that really brings a room together. Mondo\u2019s latest print collection solves that problem with style. \n\nNever Grow Up: A Disney Art Show features the work of 30 artists, each of whom got to commemorate their favorite animated Disney movie of the last 80 years\u2014from Ken Taylor\u2019s futuristic take on 2014\u2019s Big Hero 6 to James Flames\u2019 twist on 1937\u2019s Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. \n\nFor Mondo, the Austin, Texas-based gallery and print shop, Disney is a natural fit. \u201cThe movies were a big part of our childhood, and are a big part of our lives now,\u201d says co-founder and creative director Mitch Putnam. The same is true for the artists. Flames, for example, learned to draw by tracing Uncle Scrooge\u2019s beak and Mickey Mouse\u2019s ears, and still remembers watching the re-released Snow White when he was five years old at the Kingsway Theater in Brooklyn. He was so taken with the movie that he cut out the newspaper review and folded it into his sketchbook, drawing her bow and outstretched hands again and again. In his poster for the Mondo show, Flames drew Snow White and the woodland creatures emerging from a drafting table, commemorating the illustrators who created the first-ever feature-length animated film. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s somebody who actually drew all these pictures, and made them come to life,\u201d says Flames. \u201cFor me, art was always synonymous with Disney.\u201d\n\n101 DalmatiansJonathan Burton\nNever Grow Up, which Mondo is presenting alongside Cyclops Print Works, will run from April 28 through May 13. Once the show opens, 200-500 copies of each poster go up for sale. During the first weekend, they\u2019ll only be available in-person at the Mondo gallery; after that, they go online. But once they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone\u2014so if those Disney fans really want to spruce up the living room, they might want to start planning a trip to Austin. \n\nGo Back to Top.
