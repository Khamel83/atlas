      "Title": "A 5-Minute Trick for Fresher Tomatoes Food52",
      "Selection": "This trick\u2014which only takes 5 minutes\u2014may be the answer to avoiding refrigerator-chilled, flavorless tomatoes.\n\nA few weeks ago, when our Test Kitchen Manager\u00a0Derek\u00a0was doling out tomatoes that wouldn't survive the weekend in the office, I made the mistake of offering that he put them in the refrigerator. A genuine look of shock came over him as he said,\u00a0\"Put them in the refrigerator? I could never do that to a tomato!\" Over the next few weeks, I started to recognize just how much refrigerators can affect tomatoes' taste\u2014the cold temperatures cause them to lose their flavor and become mealy.\u00a0\n\nThis loss of flavor and degradation of textured\u00a0is because the cold can halt\u00a0the flavor-producing enzymes in tomatoes that thrive at room temperature.\u00a0New research suggests, however, that the same could be true of the opposite.\n\nA recent\u00a0article from Quartz\u00a0brings to light new research from\u00a0plant physiologist Jinhe Bai, who's found that dipping tomatoes in warm water\u00a0before chilling them may help them retain their flavor. He took tomatoes fresh from the vine and dipped them into 125\u00b0 F water, then chilled them\u2014and he found that the flavor remained.\n\nWe decided to test\u00a0the theory, albeit in a slightly flawed form (our tomatoes were store-bought, so it's likely that they were chilled before we ever reached them), but the findings may surprise you:\n\nThe method:\u00a0We purchased two store-bought tomatoes and placed one in a water bath at 125\u00b0 F for five minutes, then refrigerated both overnight. We allowed both tomatoes to come to room temperature (which in itself helps them recover from refrigeration),\u00a0invited\u00a0members of the Food52 to blind taste test of each tomato, then asked each person\u00a0to pick their favorite tomato.\n\nThe findings:\u00a0Of the 10 team member asked to try the tomatoes, eight of ten said that the pre-heated tomato was their favorite. Of those who chose the pre-heated tomato, almost\u00a0all cited a \"more tomato-y\" taste\u2014though to different degrees.\u00a0Caroline, our Assistant Editor, determined more \"essence of tomato\" and our C.O.O.\u00a0Bridget\u00a0said that it was \"infinitely better.\"\u00a0Amanda, our Design Editor, was perhaps the most specific, saying of the non-treated\u00a0tomato, \"This is\u00a0like chewing on paper\u2014you know when paper disintegrates in your mouth? You\u2019ll remember when you try this tomato.\" She chose the pre-heated version. But\u00a0Kristen, our Executive Editor, said that she felt the texture was slightly better.\n\nConclusion: The pre-heated tomato\u00a0had an 80% success rate, but many of the people who liked it said that its flavor was almost imperceptibly better. In a pinch, you'll find us dipping our tomatoes in warm water before refigeration\u2014better safe than sorry!\n\nWhat are some of your tricks for keeping tomatoes fresher longer?
