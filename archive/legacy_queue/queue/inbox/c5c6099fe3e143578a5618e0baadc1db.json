      "Selection": "You can\u2019t undersell the benefits of a good night\u2019s sleep; you can, however, undersell yourself on quality bedding. I myself have been a convert to linen sheeting for years now. Linen\u2019s naturally rumply state is a part of the appeal, yes (I hate making my bed), but it\u2019s also incredibly soft, breathable and easy to wash.\n\nOn the other hand, anyone who grew up needing to make their bed before leaving the house every morning might gravitate towards sateen or percale sheets; to each her own. While I can\u2019t claim to know what\u2019s right for your best night\u2019s sleep, I can say that I\u2019ve looked into a lot of options and come away with a few top contenders for the best sheets at every price point\u2014pressing optional.\n\nPhoto\u00a0by Bobbi Lin\n\nHawkins New York Stonewashed Linen Bedding\n\nFrom $198 for a queen sheet.
