Roth on 18 July 2018  Leave a Comment \n\nYesterday at the Financial Careers forum on Reddit, a user named /u/unfoldcareers posted some useful advice for job-seekers. \u201cI\u2019ve reviewed and screened thousands of resumes,\u201d /u/unfoldcareers writes, \u201cand I\u2019m sharing my preferred resume format\u2026along with my best resume advice.\u201d\n\nThe poster notes that \u201cbad resume format\u201d leads most folks to get little or nor response to their job applications. To help current job hunters, /u/unfoldcareers created a free resume template that can be downloaded via Google Docs.\n\nThe Reddit post itself contains a number of useful tips. To craft a better resume, you should:\n\nBe precise. Don\u2019t speak in general terms, but include specific numbers and metrics. Instead of saying, \u201cWas top salesperson at my company,\u201d note how many people were on the sales team, how much better you performed than everybody else, and for how long.\n\nEmphasize impact. According to /u/unfoldcareers, too many people focus on their achievements when they should really emphasize the impact they had on their company or team.\n\nStick to one page \u2014 unless you really do have decades of experience.\n\nMake it scannable. \u201cA hiring manager will review your resume for approximately 10 seconds or less,\u201d writes /u/unfoldcareers. Be sure that they\u2019ll be able to scan all of the important info quickly.\n\nExplain gaps. Don\u2019t leave a mystery. If you took time off to be a stay-at-home parent, say so.\n\nRemove the \u201cobjective\u201d line. It\u2019s irrelevant. (I did a very little hiring for our family\u2019s box factory. I never did understand why people put an objective on their resume.)\n\nRemove references. It\u2019s fine to create a separate document that contains your references so that you can provide them if asked, but don\u2019t include them on the resume itself.\n\nThe full post on Reddit includes more info, of course, along with the reasoning behind some of the recommendations.\n\nFrom my experience, most people forget is that a resume isn\u2019t really about you. That might sound strange, but the truth is that a resume is about how well your skills and experience match an employer\u2019s job requirements. Because of this, the best resumes are individually tailored to specific jobs.\n\nSure, you might create a \u201cbase\u201d or \u201cdefault\u201d resume that serves as a framework when applying for work. But you\u2019ll have greater success with your job hunt if you take the time to make subtle tweaks to this default each time you apply for a different job.\n\nAlso: I believe strongly that, whenever possible, you should hand-deliver your resume.\n\nObviously, this doesn\u2019t work for online-only applications or for positions outside your local area. But I know that when we hired at the box factory, we paid more attention to folks who had come by in person than those who simply mailed their resume. (And from watching Kim go through a couple of job searches now, I\u2019d say that one of the reasons she has such success is that she literally goes door to door, dropping her resume off at different dental offices.)\n\n\n\n",
