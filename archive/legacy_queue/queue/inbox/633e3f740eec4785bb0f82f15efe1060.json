      "Selection": "The Mrs. and I recently took a trip to Japan after being inspired to visit by a friend who lived there for a few years.\u00a0 And after visiting, we\u2019re ready to go back for round two!\u00a0 We loved just about everything \u2013 the culture, the food, the public transportation\u2026and the world-class toilets.\n\nBecause of the trip, I\u2019ve had lots of friends interested in traveling to Japan.\u00a0 So I thought I\u2019d put together a little guide on how to get to Japan using transferable points.\n\nWith Your Flexible Points, You\u2019ll Be Riding Go Karts Around Tokyo While Dressing Up in Mario Costumes in No Time!\n\nEarning transferable points is a great way to give yourself flexibility with your travel dates.\u00a0 You won\u2019t be stuck searching for available award seats or dealing with blackout dates.\n\nHow to Use Transferable Points for Flights to Japan\n\nTo keep things simple, I\u2019ll cover the best ways to fly in and out of Tokyo.\u00a0 And I won\u2019t cover every option for every different type of flexible rewards.\u00a0 Instead, I\u2019ll review the most useful and practical transfer partners.\n\nI\u2019ll cover the basics that will help you make an informed decision, things like:\n\nTransfer ratio:\u00a0 \u00a0How many points do you need to transfer to get the number of miles you need?\n\nTransfer time:\u00a0 \u00a0How long does it usually take to transfer your points to the airline?\u00a0 This is important because you don\u2019t want to find an award only to see it disappear while you\u2019re waiting for the miles to show up in your account.\n\nAward Prices:\u00a0 \u00a0How many miles will it take to book a flight to Japan with a particular airline?\n\nPartner Award Prices:\u00a0 \u00a0You can use most airline miles to book award flights on their partner airlines.\u00a0 For example, you can use United Airlines miles to book award seats on ANA.\u00a0 However, typically airlines have different award charts for their partner airlines.\u00a0 And partner award seats are usually harder to find because in many cases, you\u2019ll only be able to book the lowest priced (i.e. Saver level) awards.\u00a0 Also, sometimes airlines don\u2019t allow partner bookings for Business or First Class seats.\n\nFuel Surcharges:\u00a0 \u00a0When you book an award ticket, you\u2019ll always have to pay for taxes and fees, which can be very high depending on where you\u2019re going (i.e. London).\u00a0 But some airlines also add fuel surcharges, in addition to the taxes and fees.\u00a0 This can add $100s to the ticket cost.\u00a0 So I\u2019ll let you know whether or not you can expect these types of charges with each particular airline.\n\nPros:\u00a0 \u00a0What are the reasons you\u2019d want to transfer points to an airline?\n\nCons:\u00a0 \u00a0What are the downsides of transferring points to an airline?\n\nOther notes:\u00a0 \u00a0If there are any special rules, tips, or ticks you should know for the airline, they\u2019ll be covered here.\n\nHow to Get to Japan With Chase Ultimate Rewards Points\n\nYou can earn transferable Chase Ultimate Rewards points with the following cards:\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae\n\nInk Business Preferred\u2120 Credit Card\n\nAnd the Chase Ultimate Rewards points you earn with the following no-annual-fee cards can be pooled onto the \u201cpremium\u201d cards listed above, and then transferred to Chase\u2019s travel partners:\n\nChase Freedom\u00ae\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited\u00ae\n\nInk Business Cash\u2120 Credit Card\n\nInk Business Unlimited\u2120 Credit Card\n\nBritish Airways\n\nBritish Airways operates a distance-based award chart, so British Airways Avios points aren\u2019t the most universally useful rewards for booking awards to Japan.\u00a0 With British Airways, you\u2019ll pay based on the distance of the flight segment, NOT the total flight distance.\u00a0 So shorter non-stop flights can be a good deal, but if you need a connecting flight you\u2019ll pay extra for it!\n\nTransfer ratio:\u00a0 \u00a01:1\n\nTransfer time:\u00a0 \u00a0Instant\n\nAward Prices:\u00a0 \u00a0British Airways operates a distance-based award chart.\u00a0 You can use the Great Circle Mapper\u00a0to estimate the distance of each segment of your flight.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBritish Airways Avios

Award Prices:\u00a0 \u00a0British Airways uses the same chart for their awards and partner awards unless you book a flight with 2+ or more partner airlines.\u00a0 In that case, you\u2019ll want to reference this chart.\u00a0 You\u2019ll notice that the prices aren\u2019t good and the fees are hefty.\n\nWith almost all partner awards, you can only book the peak price.\n\nWith British Airways Avios points, you can book Japan Airlines flights under 650 miles within Japan for 4,500 Avios one-way + taxes & fees.\u00a0 And from some West Coast cities, you can book one-way awards on partners like American Airlines or Japan Airlines starting at 25,000 British Airways Avios points + taxes & fees.\u00a0 But your options for flying cheaply to Japan are limited.\n\nFuel Surcharges:\u00a0 \u00a0Yes\n\nPros:\u00a0 \u00a0Great for booking short-haul flights within Japan or non-stop flights from the West Coast\n\nCons:\u00a0 \u00a0Not good for folks who can\u2019t fly non-stop or need to fly farther to get to Japan, higher fuel surcharges & fees on some flights\n\nOther notes:\n\nFor more tips check out our complete guide to British Airways Avios points!\n\nKorean Air\n\nThe price of award flights on Korean Air from North America to Japan varies between peak and off-peak dates.\u00a0 You can book round-trip coach flights from the US to Japan for only 70,000 Korean Air miles during off-peak times.\u00a0 Typically, the off-peak dates cover ~9 months of the year!\n\nTransfer ratio:\u00a0 \u00a01:1\n\nTransfer time:\u00a0 \u00a02 to 7 business days, but you can hold award seats while waiting for the transfer\n\nAward Prices:\u00a0 \u00a0All of the award prices listed in this chart are for round-trip flights, one-way awards cost half as much:\n\nRound-Trip Award Flight Prices With Korean Air Miles\n\nKorean Air calls their Business Class \u201cPrestige\u201d and the peak and off-peak dates change each year.\u00a0 You can check the dates here.\n\nPartner Award Prices:\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nKorean Air is a member of the SkyTeam alliance.\u00a0 So you can use Korean Air miles to book non-stop award flights to Japan on partners like Delta.\u00a0 There are no peak or off-peak prices for the partner award chart.\u00a0 This is nice because you can book these awards starting at 80,000 Korean Air miles round-trip in coach, even during the busy season!\n\nBut you can NOT book one-way award flights on partner airlines.\u00a0 The following chart lists the round-trip partner award price:\n\nRound-Trip Partner Award Flight Prices Using Korean Air Miles\n\nAsia 1 includes Korea & Japan.\n\nFuel Surcharges:\u00a0 \u00a0They do add fuel surcharges on award flights, but for Korean Air flights and Delta partner flights to Japan, the fees are reasonable.\n\nPros:\u00a0 \u00a0Lots of available award seats on Korean Air flights, especially Business & First Class (but recently folks have been reporting that Korean Air isn\u2019t as generous with opening award seats as they used to be), free stopover (layover of 24+ hours) on one-way\u00a0award flights (on Korean Air flights only), free stopover &\u00a01\u00a0open jaw\u00a0(flying into a city, leaving from another) on partner award flights\n\nCons:\u00a0 \u00a0Partner awards can be harder to find (I\u2019m looking at you Delta), you can only book awards for specific family members\n\nOther notes:\n\nKorean Air only allows you to book awards for eligible family members.\n\nFor more tips on booking awards with Korean Air miles check out our guide!\n\nSingapore Airlines\n\nSingapore Airlines miles are not particularly useful for getting to Japan.\u00a0 The biggest advantage they have is how easy they are to earn.\u00a0 You can transfer points from Citi ThankYou, Chase Ultimate Rewards, AMEX Membership Rewards, and Marriott / Starwood to Singapore Airlines.\u00a0 So if you don\u2019t have enough flexible points to get to Japan in any single program, you can easily combine points together and book award flights with Singapore Airlines miles.\n\nTransfer ratio:\u00a0 \u00a01:1\n\nTransfer time:\u00a0 \u00a0Up to 2 days\n\nAward Prices:\u00a0 \u00a0Japan is in Zone 7 of the Singapore Airlines award chart.\u00a0 Award flights from the West Coast are comparable in price to other options for coach flights, but Singapore Airlines only flies from Los Angeles to Tokyo.\u00a0 And I\u2019m not sure how easy it is to find available award seats.\u00a0 I searched on the Singapore Airlines website for ~15 minutes and could only find partner award flights.\u00a0 Maybe you\u2019ll have better luck.\n\nOne-Way Saver Award Prices With Singapore Airlines Miles\n\nBecause of Singapore Airlines\u2019 more restrictive routing rules, I couldn\u2019t find flights with Singapore Airlines from the East Coast.\u00a0 But even if you can find those award seats, you\u2019re better off booking a partner award, which will cost fewer miles.\u00a0 But you\u2019ll want to pay attention to fuel surcharges with certain airlines.\n\nPartner Award Prices:\u00a0 \u00a0Singapore Airlines is a member of Star Alliance.\u00a0 You can book awards with their partner airlines from North America to Japan for:\n\nCoach\u00a0\u2013\u00a0108,000 Singapore Airlines miles\u00a0round-trip\n\nBusiness Class \u2013 210,000 Singapore Airlines miles round-trip\n\nFirst Class\u00a0\u2013 250,000 Singapore Airlines miles round-trip\n\nOne-way partner awards are half the price of the round-trip partner awards.\n\nFuel Surcharges:\u00a0 \u00a0Singapore Airlines does not add fuel surcharges to their own flights.\u00a0 But if you\u2019re booking a partner award flight you\u2019ll pay fuel surcharges when the airline you\u2019re flying with has them.\u00a0 Most European & Asian airlines add hefty fuel surcharges.\u00a0 But others, like United Airlines, don\u2019t have any fuel surcharges.\n\nPros:\u00a0 \u00a0Some of the easiest airline miles to earn as they transfer from Chase Ultimate Rewards, AMEX Membership Rewards, Citi ThankYou, and Marriott / Starwood\n\nCons:\u00a0 \u00a0High cost of awards and restrictive routing rules\n\nOther notes:\n\nYou are allowed 1 stopover (layover of 24+ hours) & 1\u00a0open jaw\u00a0(origin or destination is not the same) on round-trip Saver award flights\n\nYou can add stopovers on award flights for $100 each (up to 3 total), but you can\u2019t book them online\n\nUnited Airlines\n\nUnited Airlines prices their awards as \u201cSaver\u201d awards and \u201cEveryday\u201d awards.\u00a0 Saver awards are much cheaper, so those are what you\u2019ll want to find and book.\u00a0 Everyday awards can be absurdly expensive and are typically\u00a0NOT a good deal.\n\nTransfer ratio:\u00a0 \u00a01:1\n\nTransfer time:\u00a0 \u00a0Instant\n\nAward Prices:\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nCoach\u00a0\u2013 35,000 United Airlines miles for a\u00a0one-way Saver Award, up to\u00a080,000 United Airlines miles\u00a0for a one-way Everyday Award\n\nBusiness Class \u2013 70,000 United Airlines miles\u00a0for a\u00a0one-way Saver Award, up to\u00a0175,000 United Airlines miles\u00a0for a one-way Everyday Award\n\nFirst Class \u2013 90,000 United Airlines miles\u00a0for a\u00a0one-way Saver Award, up to\u00a0200,000 United Airlines miles for a one-way Everyday Award\n\nPartner Award Prices:\n\nCoach\u00a0\u2013\u00a035,000 United Airlines miles\u00a0one-way\n\nBusiness Class \u2013 80,000 United Airlines miles one-way\n\nFirst Class\u00a0\u2013 110,000 United Airlines miles one-way\n\nFuel Surcharges:\u00a0 \u00a0No, United Airlines does not add fuel surcharges for their award flights or partner award flights!\n\nPros:\u00a0 \u00a0United Airlines awards are\u00a0easy to find and book\u00a0and typically there are lots of available award seats\n\nI Did This Search for United Airlines Award Seats From Chicago to Tokyo on July 17, 2018, and You Can See There Are Plenty of Last-Minute Seats!\u00a0 Plus, It Only Gets Better the Farther Out You Search or If You Have a United Airlines Credit Card!\n\nCons:\u00a0 \u00a0Business & First Class partner awards and Everyday Awards are expensive!\n\nOther notes:\n\nUnited Airlines charges a booking fee of $75 for award flights booked within 21 days of departure. \u00a0But you might be able to\u00a0avoid it with this trick!\n\nUnited Airlines allows a free stopover or a free one-way on round-trip award flights in the form of the \u201cUnited Airlines Excursionist Perk\u201d\u00a0\n\nIf you have one of the Chase United Airlines credit cards or United Airlines elite status, you\u2019ll have access to more available award seats!\n\nFor more on how to book awards with United Airlines miles check out our Ultimate Guide to United Airlines Miles!\n\nVirgin Atlantic\n\nVirgin Atlantic doesn\u2019t fly to Tokyo or Japan, but they are worth mentioning because they have one of the best options for partner award flights from the US to Japan.\u00a0 And Virgin Atlantic miles are super easy to collect.\n\nTransfer ratio:\u00a0 \u00a01:1\n\nTransfer time:\u00a0 \u00a0Instant\n\nAward Prices:\u00a0 \u00a0There are no Virgin Atlantic flights to Tokyo or Japan.\n\nPartner Award Prices:\u00a0 \u00a0Virgin Atlantic has a different award chart for each partner airline.\u00a0 You can check them out here.\u00a0 But the only useful partner is ANA, and when I say useful, I mean amazing!\n\nAll the prices below are for round-trip awards \u2013 you can NOT book one-way partner award flights:\n\nRound-Trip Partner Award Prices on ANA Using Virgin Atlantic Miles\n\nThose prices aren\u2019t typos!\u00a0 You can book a First Class partner award on ANA from the West Coast to Japan for only 110,000 Virgin Atlantic miles!\u00a0 That\u2019s only 2,000 miles more than what it would take for a Singapore Airlines partner award in coach!\n\nUnfortunately, you cannot book partner award flights online.\u00a0 You\u2019ll have to book them over the phone (800-365-9500).\n\nFuel Surcharges:\u00a0 \u00a0Yes, but the fuel surcharges on ANA flights are reasonable.\u00a0 I checked a few different flights from the US to Japan and saw fuel surcharges in the $170 range, and you\u2019ll spend an additional ~$100 in taxes & fees.\n\nPros:\u00a0 \u00a0Incredible ANA awards, you can transfer\u00a0Chase Ultimate Rewards, AMEX Membership Rewards, Citi ThankYou, and Marriott / Starwood points to Virgin Atlantic \u2013 so they\u2019re easy to earn!\n\nCons:\u00a0 \u00a0Can\u2019t search for or book partner awards online, only one useful award flight option to Japan, fuel surcharges on award flights\n\n\u00a0Other notes:\n\nYou can search for ANA awards on the United Airlines website or Air Canada\u2019s Aeroplan site and then call Virgin Atlantic to book the flights.\n\nBottom Line\n\nJapan is one place that should be on your bucket list!\u00a0 Even outside of cherry blossom season, it is one of the most beautiful and cleanest countries I\u2019ve visited.\u00a0 And the people couldn\u2019t be more helpful!\n\nPlus, getting there doesn\u2019t have to cost a fortune!\u00a0 With transferable points, there\u2019s no shortage of options for booking award flights.\u00a0 So I\u2019m putting together this guide on how to use flexible points to visit Japan.\n\nFor the next installment of this series, I\u2019ll be covering how to get to Japan using AMEX Membership Rewards points.\n",
