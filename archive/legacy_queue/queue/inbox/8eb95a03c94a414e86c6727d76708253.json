      "Title": "How to live your best #vanlife The Verge",
      "Selection": "Once upon a time I went through a breakup and it sucked very much, thank you. We\u2019d been living together for five years, and when it came time to figure out where I wanted to live next, I realized that I didn\u2019t want to commit to an apartment, a city, or even a state. So, instead, I bought a van. It was a 2006 Freightliner Sprinter that was already converted into a small Class B RV by Gulf Stream, model name Vista Cruiser G24. After five months of exhaustive research, it was the only van I could find that had the exact layout I was looking for.\n\nBut as a writer that covers a lot of tech and gadgets, I knew that if I wanted to be able to continue working from the road (mandatory), I was going to have to make some modifications so it could keep up with my geeky lifestyle. And if I was going to be living in it full time, I wanted it to have as many creature comforts as possible. So I made some upgrades. A lot of upgrades. By the time I hit the road on July 15th, 2015 for a road trip that I would call Connected States, my van (Ashley \u201cThe Beast\u201d) was properly equipped, and it\u2019s continued to evolve.\n\nI\u2019m now more than two years in and I\u2019ve learned a lot over that time. The following is my list of the best gear for #vanlife.\n\nNote: because the van I ended up buying was already converted, it already had the basics included. We\u2019re talking about a bed, a fridge and microwave, a toilet, shower, and sink, plus holding tanks for fresh, gray, and black water. These things are obviously important but the focus of this piece is on upgrades beyond the basics.\n\nFirst step: Power up\n\nThe first and largest upgrade I made was an overhaul the electrical system. It was the single most expensive addition, but also the most worth it. (This upgrade cost about one-fifth of what I paid for the van itself. Ouch.) Because this dealt with drilling, running wires behind panels, and things that could catch fire and/or explode if done improperly, I decided to have professionals do it, and I took the van to AM Solar in Springfield, OR. They were reputed to be the best in all the forums I\u2019d read, and they did not disappoint.\n\nThey managed to squeeze two 160 watt solar panels onto my roof, for a total of 320 watts. Not at all bad for a smaller rig. The power runs down into an extremely beefy 3000 watt hybrid Magnum Energy inverter/charger, and then into a custom built 200 amp-hour lithium battery array. This might sound like overkill, but it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe \u201chouse battery\u201d (i.e. the battery for living, not for the engine) that my van came with was a standard, 80aH AGM battery. They\u2019re cheaper, but once you drain them past 50 percent there\u2019s a serious voltage-drop and you risk damaging the battery, so you really only get 40 usable amp-hours. Lithium batteries, while very pricey, are not only more power-dense, but you can drain them as far as 20 or even 10 percent before you get much voltage drop, and you aren\u2019t likely to damage them. That means that now I had more like 160-180 usable amp-hours of energy per charge, and it fit in the same space as the old AGM battery.\n\nLithium also charges quicker (it can pull up to 80 amps from the alternator when my engine is running) and can let out its juice faster, too, which is where that big 3,000-watt inverter comes in. Before, if I wanted to microwave something or even use the van\u2019s hot water heater for a shower, I either had to be plugged into shore power (which I rarely am) or using my noisy propane generator, which isn\u2019t exactly incognito. Now I can run either appliance, and keep all of my gadgets charged via AC outlets, off of the battery, completely silently. It was a total game-changer.\n\nGetting connected\n\nAs someone who works on the internet, having reliable internet access is kinda important. Fast 4G mobile internet is one of the primary reasons why there are so many #vanlifers these days. I\u2019ve driven more than 60,000 miles, zigzagging around the U.S. and two products have served me extremely well. The first is the Verizon Jetpack MiFi 6620L which has covered me just about everywhere in the country for most of the first two years of this journey. For basically everywhere else, I\u2019m using the ZTE Falcon Z-917 on T-Mobile\u2019s network, which has delivered solid speeds even in squirrely canyons. Both seem to have stronger antennas and deliver faster data speeds compared to phones on the same networks.\n\nThese devices have a bit of help, too. I\u2019ve been using the WeBoost Drive 4G-X signal booster. A small antenna magnetically attaches to the roof of the van and connects to a box (which I\u2019ve now permanently wall-mounted), that plugs into a DC outlet. It isn\u2019t night and day, but it typically adds 1-2 bars of reception when it\u2019s turned on, so I basically just always leave it on. When I was in Big Bend National Park in Texas I had zero reception. When I turned it on I got one bar, which was enough to make a phone call and text my family back home. The only times I had no signal from either Verizon or T-Mobile and the WeBoost didn\u2019t help was when I was in extremely remote areas or deep into National Parks.\n\nIf things get really desperate, I have the Garmin inReach Explorer+ satellite communicator. Not only does it have offline topographic maps, but it allows me to send and receive text messages via satellite. There\u2019s also an SOS button you can hit which will immediately send in search and rescue no matter where you are. I also carry this with me whenever I\u2019m hiking or mountain biking alone. I consider it a good insurance policy.\n\nI\u2019ve shuffled phones a few times but for the last year I\u2019ve been using the Google Pixel XL with a Verizon SIM, and it\u2019s been extremely solid. It\u2019s fast, battery life is reliable, and the photos it takes are unbeatable amongst phones. I also have a T-Mobile SIM which I swap in when needs be.\n\nLocking it down\n\nSo, I\u2019ve got a fair amount of gadgets in here and I\u2019m often out of the van exploring, and/or parking in unfamiliar neighborhoods, so I need to keep my stuff and myself safe. So I got a top-of-the-line security system from Viper. This included the 5806 system, plus GPS SmartStart. It\u2019s a two-way system so if my alarm goes off my keychain will ring even if I\u2019m up to a mile away and I\u2019ll get an alert on my phone, even if I\u2019m across the country.\n\nIt also has a microphone so it can detect the sound of shattering glass. It adds an extra layer of security, but it\u2019s made for a few humorous moments. Apparently, my sneeze sound like glass breaking, as does accidentally dropping my keys on the floor. The smartphone app isn\u2019t a gimmick either. I can see exactly where I parked and even unlock the van for a friend to grab something when I\u2019m elsewhere. It also lets me start the van remotely, which is nice in winter.\n\nBut even with that killer security system, I wanted some extra protection. So I completely dismantled one of my precious cabinets and I installed the Viking Security Safe VS-38BL with biometric fingerprint scanner. It\u2019s big enough to fit my laptop, cameras, hard drives, and microphones, no problem. I\u2019ve also installed it in such a way that there\u2019s no way to get it out of the van without completely disassembling the bed, which would take a lot of time. The fingerprint scanner is kind of excessive, but hey, it\u2019s supposed to be a teched-out van so I decided to go all in, and it does make it easier to open in the dark.\n\nIf things ever get really dire, I have this flashlight: the Vipertek VTS-195. It has a powerful 400 lumen beam. Oh and it\u2019s also a stun gun capable of delivering a 25,000,000 volt zap (though, interestingly enough, the company has stopped listing the voltage since I purchased it). I can confirm that getting shocked with it really, really hurts a lot. I also have a Louisville Slugger, should a low-tech option be necessary.\n\nBoom Boom\n\nFor the installation of the Viper system I went to All Pro Audio in Santa Clara, CA, and I started talking with owner Jim Lee about audio stuff. See, I really wanted a system that could run Android Auto, but all Android Auto capable systems required a double-DIN slot, which is the taller, closer-to-square slot for a car stereo. My van had a single-din slot, so I thought I was out of luck. Jim said, \u201cY\u2019know, we could cut open your dash to expand the slot\u2026\u201d Oh hell yes.\n\nI went with the Pioneer AVIC-8100NEX\u2014 the flagship at the time \u2014 which is capable of running both Android Auto and Apple Car Play. It has a capacitive touch screen, and it works with a backup cam, which I had Jim install, too. (Backing The Beast up is a lot less stressful now). The whole install matches the rest of my dash perfectly, and being able to use Google Maps and stream music as I make my way across the country has been great.\n\nJim noted that I was going to have this nice new stereo head but it would be running through two wimpy speakers built into the dash. Those speakers produced almost zero bass. I told him I\u2019d been thinking of installing a self-powered subwoofer called the Kicker BassStation under the table behind the driver\u2019s seat, so we did that. Then, during the installation he called me and said there\u2019s actually room for two more speakers at the base of the captain\u2019s chairs.\n\nI had him pop in a pair of Phoenix Gold 6x9 RX speakers. The result? I now have way more sound than I need, and I\u2019ve gone mad with power. It\u2019s not an audiophile-grade system, but I\u2019m really impressed with the sound for the price. My audio engineer friend Greg Sextro even made me a custom EQ setting, tuning the system to the resonant frequency of the van\u2019s interior. It sounds fantastic and listening to music is now pure joy.\n\nThe capper was that Jim\u2019s team built a fake faceplate for the stereo to make it look old and junky and less theft-worthy. It\u2019s one of my very favorite upgrades.\n\nMood Lighting\n\nThe van came with a whole bunch of small incandescent bulbs and a few fluorescent tubes. The incandescents get hot and suck a fair amount of power. So I took a quick trip to an RV supply store in Santa Cruz, CA and managed to find replacement LEDs in all the right sizes. The fluorescent replacements took a bit of rewiring (thanks for the help, dad!) but it was pretty simple. The interior is now brighter yet it uses about one fifth the amount of energy.\n\nThe only problem is that bright LEDs are can be harsh and not great for relaxing, so I leveled-up in a big way and installed Phillips Hue LightStrips in a ring around the ceiling. Not only does this give me even lighting throughout the interior, but I can change the lights to any color I want or even put it in disco mode with a third-party app. It wasn\u2019t trivial to rig it up for mobile life because my 4G hotspots don\u2019t have Ethernet ports, which you need to connect the Hue hub to. So I had to install a D-Link DAP 1650 Extender and Access Point. Basically, it acted as a repeater for my hotspot\u2019s Wi-Fi, and I could plug the hub into it. Once I had that set up I installed the Hue Dimmer Switch and the Hue Tap Switch (both of which work when the system is offline) so I could change color modes without needing Wi-Fi to be on every time. Basically, it was a pain in the ass to set up, but it was beyond worth it. It\u2019s amazing how much that has changed the look and feel of the van.\n\nMiscellaneous Miracles\n\nBecause my van was already converted it already had an AC/DC fridge, a microwave, and a two-burner propane stove, so it\u2019s pretty well set-up for cooking, and I\u2019d say I make about 75-percent of my meals in the van (which helps me eat cheaper and healthier while on the road). It isn\u2019t without its challenges, though. With cabinet space at a premium I\u2019ve experimented with a number of coffee-making systems over the last two years. It started out with a French press, which was kind of bulky and took a lot of precious water to clean. Eventually I discovered this amazing Better Housewares Collapsible Tea Kettle, which I instantly feel in love with. It hardly takes up any space, and allows me to make pour-overs. I experimented with a couple mesh systems from Bodum, but they too took up a ton of space and were also tough to clean. Finally I discovered this Snow Peak Folding Coffee Pour Over Brewer, which is made of stainless steel and folds away into nothing. I use biodegradable #2 coffee filters, so there\u2019s basically no cleanup, it takes up hardly any space, and it makes killer coffee.\n\nI also have a Joule Sous Vide by Chef Steps. Because it\u2019s small and this is a high-tech van so why the hell not.\n\nThe number one pain-point of vanlife is finding a place to park. Sometimes you end up parking pretty far from where you want to be. Because of that I wanted a folding bike, so I could keep it safely inside my trunk space, but also one that was tough enough to handle single-track. Enter the Montague Swissbike X90. It has full 26-inch wheels as well as very cushy front suspension, and it sets up and breaks down in a hurry. I\u2019ve taken it on trails in Moab, Marquette, Giant Sequoia National Monument, and many other places and I\u2019m always amazed at how well it handles. I added Shimano XTR M9020 Trail SPD pedals so I could ride with or without bike shoes. Montague has a new model out with 27.5-inch wheels I\u2019m dying to try.\n\nI\u2019ve tested more than a dozen different backpacks over the last couple years, and the one I keep coming back to is the Mountainsmith Borealis. It\u2019s the first backpack I\u2019ve found that has ample (padded) room for my cameras, lenses, and mics, but also plenty of space for food, clothes, and even a sleeping bag and pad. It has a built-in rain-cover, a separate laptop sleeve, ample padding for the hips, and it fits under most airplane seats. If I\u2019m actually backpacking backpacking, though, I use the Gregory Baltoro 75, which is well laid-out, has a ton of space, and there\u2019s even a built-in 7-watt Goal Zero solar panel for gadget charging. For a quick hike or snowboarding at a resort I use the Eddie Bauer Bacon Pack which is super light, hydration-bladder compatible, and has nice organization and plenty of room for a day\u2019s recreation.\n\nI\u2019m also using a the Peak Design Clip Pro, which I can attach to the strap of any backpack (or belt), and allows me to hike with my camera out, without it constantly bashing into my sternum. I\u2019ve only had it for a few weeks and I don\u2019t know how I went the last two years without it.\n\nBasically, any item you select for your van needs to be evaluated for its versatility. One of the advantages of #vanlife is being able to be on the beach during one season, and in the mountains the next. I knew I could only fit one surfboard in the trunk, so I went with a 5\u2019 8\u201d Rusty DWART which is a shape that can handle an extremely wide variety of waves. It\u2019s made with Varial foam, which not only makes it stronger, but gives it way more float for its diminutive size. For a snowboard (which I only travel with during winter) I got a custom stick from Wagner Custom Skis. They don\u2019t even advertise that they make boards, but they\u2019re happy to do one for you, and they\u2019re incredible. Every one is custom-made, so mine is built for my height, weight, and riding style, and I had them design a shape that can twist through trees but still float over powder. I even got one of my own photos put on the deck. I pair it with The Ride 92 snowboard boots, which are incredibly comfy, offer great tread, and look cool at the bar.\n\nVersatility translates to the things you wear, too. I need to give a special mention to what I consider the best shoes I\u2019ve ever owned: the Keen\u2019s Glenhaven Mid. They comfortable, quick to put on because of the bungee laces, and the look good pretty much everywhere. I\u2019ve worn them to important meetings, on dates, and just walking around cities. It looks like the Mid is being discontinued, which breaks my heart, but there\u2019s a new lower-cut version I\u2019m hoping will prove just as worthy. The applies to exercise, too. For a while I had two pairs of running shoes: One for street and one for trail. Eventually, I found the Altra Lone Peak 2.5, which work incredibly well for both. They have wide toe boxes, they\u2019re zero drop, and have excellent tread and padding. They have become my all-time favorite running shoe.\n\nThis may seem like a small thing, but it makes a huge difference. A lot of vans and RVs have ceiling fans (usually made by Fantastic or MaxxFan). They\u2019re indispensable for getting hot air (or cooking smells) out, and it\u2019s a safe way to leave a window open. My recommendation is to get a plastic cover for you fan, like the one you see here. Yes, they\u2019re dorky-looking, but it gives you the ability to keep your fan open and running even when it\u2019s raining, which is often when it\u2019s muggiest. You can leave you fan door open and explore the city without worrying about a sudden thunderstorm. It\u2019s a great addition.\n\nWhen Stuff Breaks\n\nWhen things break, you need to have some tools handy. My number-one most-used tool is the Leatherman Wave multi-tool which I\u2019ve been using for more than a decade now. For bigger jobs, I grabbed a soft-bag toolkit from Denali, which was cheap and is easily shoved into a cabinet, but it has a wide variety of things one might need. For drilling and screwdriving, I\u2019ve been extremely happy with the Porter Cable Max Compact Lithium Drill/Driver. It\u2019s small and light, but it has plenty of torque and fantastic battery-life.\n\nFor cleaning up, I\u2019ve been heavily reliant on the Black + Decker 20V Max Lithium Flex Vac. It\u2019s small enough to pack into a little cabinet, but it offers excellent suction, and the detachable hose is critical for getting into tight spaces, which a converted van is full of. I also use a ton of Gorilla Tape (and Gorilla Clear Repair Tape) for quick fixes, and I end up velcroing a lot of things to walls (notice my velcro shoe rack in the photo of the speakers above).\n\nWork Tools\n\nLastly, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the stuff I\u2019ve been using for work. I have an aging MacBook Pro which I\u2019m hoping will last me a bit longer. For external hard drives I\u2019ve been using the Seagate Backup Plus Ultra Slim in the 2TB flavor. I\u2019ve found them to be fast and reliable and they can fit in my jeans pocket. They haven\u2019t let me down yet (knock wood).\n\nFor camera, I\u2019ve got the Sony A7S, which is a small and lightweight full-frame mirrorless camera that\u2019s unbeatable in low-light (except by Sony\u2019s own A7S II and the A9). It\u2019s gotten me the best Milky Way shots of my life. My go-to drone for aerial shots has been the DJI Phantom 3 Pro, but I\u2019m probably going to swap it for the smaller DJI Mavic Pro soon, simply because it\u2019s so much more packable. Hell, it would even fit in my safe.\n\nI use a GoPro Hero5 Black for a rugged solution I can just throw in my pocket (or stick on my helmet or surfboard) when I\u2019m about to do something stupid. It also acts as my video journal of the whole road trip, thanks to a sticky mount I attached to my dashboard. It shoots killer wide-angle footage, it\u2019s waterproof as is, and the built-in screen is nice for quickly framing a shot. I\u2019ve also been messing with the Karma Grip stabilizer while snowboarding, mountain biking, and just trying to get smooth handheld panning shots, and found that in general it works really well.\n\nFor capturing audio, I use a Zoom H6 as my go-to digital recorder and a Blue Yeti Pro USB mic for all of my voice-recording needs. Between the two I\u2019ve been able to record voiceovers for TV pilots, podcasts, as well as the occasional song, and the quality has never let me down. When I\u2019m recording on location I use a pair of aging Sennheiser G2 wireless lavalier mics. If you\u2019re looking, you\u2019ll want the newer G3 system. For monitoring (and listening to music in general), I\u2019ve been using the Sennheiser Urbanite on-ear headphones. They have very nicely-balanced sound, a built-in mic, and they aren\u2019t insanely expensive. You can see all three of these items in the video above.\n\nThere are tons of other little tweaks and additions I\u2019ve made over the last two years, but these are the main tools that have really improved my vanlife. This was originally supposed to be a one-year project, but when I hit that point I realized that I didn\u2019t want to stop, and I didn\u2019t need to, in part because of all these additions. I may live in a small, mobile space, but I\u2019ve found it to be surprisingly comfortable, and I\u2019ve managed to stay productive despite the constant siren call of new experiences just outside my door. Currently, the plan is to keep going until it stops being fun or until I find something better. If you want to read more about life on the road, check out my blog for the trip at ConnectedStates.com. And if you have any questions hit me up on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook and I\u2019ll do my best to answer them.\n\nPhotography by Brent Rose for The Verge.\n\nVox Media has affiliate partnerships.
