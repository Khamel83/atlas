      "Title": "It\u2019s time for us to admit that whether or not we succeed in life is mostly about luck Quartz",
      "Selection": "The natural state of the artist is one of bitterness and incredulous jealousy. How on earth can Scott Adams prosper when Dilbert looks as if it\u2019s drawn by a near-sighted warthog? Why does Thomas Friedman have a platform at the New York Times, when I could write bland, self-aggrandizing piffle just as well, and in a punchier prose style? Michelangelo insulted Leonardo Da Vinci in public for not finishing a statue; Remy Ma dissed Nicki Minaj, and vice versa; Richard Ford literally spit on Colson Whitehead at a party in retaliation for a poor book review. Artists are incredibly competitive; if someone else is succeeding, they think, \u201cThat person is getting more credit than they deserve, and I am not getting enough.\u201d\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t true of all artists. But it is more likely to be true of those who believe that success is a meritocracy. If recognition is linked to artistic quality, you\u2019re more likely to be angry when your own merit is not being recognized and celebrated. There\u2019s just one problem: meritocracy is not how creative success\u2014or really, most professional success\u2014actually works.\n\nFor the most part, creative success has little to do with talent or hard work. Lots of people are talented and hard-working. Talented and hard-working people are nothing special, for better or worse. To be successful, you need more than just talent and hard work. You need luck. Or, even better than luck, you need connections.\n\nAnd yet artists persist in the belief that their success, or lack thereof, reveals something deeper about their worth. Writing in The Guardian, an anonymous author and self-proclaimed failed novelist recently published a mournfully angry piece about their lack of success. \u201cI \u2026 avoid literary debuts by British female writers, which all seem so safe and samey,\u201d the writer declared. \u201cI feel pity and scorn for people with dreams.\u201d In a follow-up piece, novelist David Barnett responded with scorn, albeit not with pity. \u201cDear Anonymous, you\u2019re not a failure. You\u2019re a quitter.\u201d Bennett goes on, with sententious enthusiasm, \u201cI failed over and over again; but each time, I failed better.\u201d\n\nBoth writers are making the same error: They assume that failure and success are signals of artistic merit. The anonymous writer thinks they\u2019ve failed because they doesn\u2019t write \u201csafe, samey\u201d fiction; they\u2019re too daring to get a book deal. Barnett thinks the anonymous writer has failed because they haven\u2019t tried hard enough. Both attitudes lead to self-aggrandizement, and a lack of respect\u2014or compassion\u2014for others\u2019 experiences.\n\nBut success is more of a structural than individual feat. Consider Sofia Coppola. There are hardly any female directors in Hollywood; the number of women filmmakers actually dropped in recent years. Coppola, whose dad is one of the most acclaimed and successful filmmakers in the history of cinema, is one of the few exceptions. Her connections helped her overcome systemic bias. That\u2019s not a comment on Sofia Coppola\u2019s talent one way or the other. It\u2019s a simple acknowledgment that privilege and connections matter a lot\u2014even more so when you\u2019re dealing with a system that\u2019s inherently biased against you.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to keep in mind that success is often a matter of being in the right place at the right time. One 2006 sociological study of music downloads found that people were much more likely to listen to a song that they were told was already popular. Economist Alan Krueger has pointed out that this means that success snowballs, regardless of talent.\n\nPopularity is its own logic, mostly divorced from questions of quality. This means that people with money can game the system; if you spend enough on marketing, millions of people will see Batman vs. Superman, no matter how turgid and confused it is. It also means that timing, and what other art happens to be released at the same time, can have a huge effect on success. \u201cThe difference between a Sugar Man, a Dylan and a Post Break Tragedy depends a lot more on luck than is commonly acknowledged,\u201d Krueger concluded.\n\nIf creative success is a crapshoot, how should we feel about it? On one hand, it\u2019s depressing. The fact that you\u2019re more likely to succeed if you\u2019re rich, or white, or a man, is inherently unjust, and perpetuates further injustice. And it\u2019s disheartening to realize that luck can matter more than talent. You can be brilliant; you can work from sun-up to sun-down. Yet you may be forced to watch from the sidelines as others receive the recognition that is never coming your way.\n\nBut freeing yourself from the myth of meritocracy can also be liberating. If you fail, it\u2019s not your fault. And if you succeed, it\u2019s not because you\u2019re better than everybody else. Your unique genius has neither doomed you to obscurity, nor elevated you to the heights.\n\nWhen we stop seeing professional success as a measure of our worth, we\u2019re in a much better position to be kind\u2014both to ourselves and to each other. Economist Robert H. Frank at the Atlantic has pointed out that when people believe they have succeeded through hard work rather than luck, they tend to be less open to helping others. Conversely, when people understand the role that luck has played in their achievements, they are more sympathetic to the struggles of others, and more likely to act with generosity.\n\nCreative success is not an exercise in social Darwinism. We don\u2019t need to go out there and tear down other artists in order to advance ourselves. Once we recognize that, we can stop alternating between self-loathing and free-ranging resentment, and start focusing criticism at real injustices\u2014like lack of health care, old boy\u2019s networks, white supremacy, and other systems that make art less rewarding and more unjust. Once you stop believing in meritocracy, solidarity gets a lot easier.\n\nLearn how to write for Quartz Ideas. We welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com.\n\nMost Popular\n",
