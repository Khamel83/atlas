Follow The Points Guy on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0Twitter, and subscribe to text message alerts from our deals feed, @tpg_alerts.\n\nAirfare deals are typically\u00a0only\u00a0available on limited dates. We recommend you use\u00a0Google Flights\u00a0to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia, which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you\u2019re using the\u00a0American Express Platinum Card, you\u2019ll need to\u00a0book directly with the airline or through Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points. Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of\u00a0Orbitz\u00a0or\u00a0Expedia\u2019s courtesy cancellation if you\u2019re unable to get the time away from work or family.\n\nStart packing your bags for a trip to the 50th state. As competition heats up during an off-peak time, flights from California are pricing out for less than $300 round-trip. Meanwhile, the central US has multiple options for less than $500 round-trip. Even the East Coast can fly all the way to Hawaii for less than $600 round-trip.\n\nWe\u2019ve listed the best options we could find below, but there might be even more deals we didn\u2019t find. So make sure to do some digging on\u00a0Google Flights\u00a0if a city near you isn\u2019t listed below.\n\nThe easiest way to find these deals is to search for cheap dates via\u00a0Google Flights.
