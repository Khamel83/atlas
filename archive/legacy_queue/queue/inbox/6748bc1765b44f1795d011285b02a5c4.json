      "Selection": "Churning, swirling, sucking swaths of water, rip currents are a scary experience for anyone unfortunate enough to be caught in one. Often inaccurately called riptides, rip currents are formed when ocean waves get forced between obstacles\u00a0\u2014\u00a0like coral reefs, sandbars, piers, or rocks\u00a0\u2014\u00a0on their way back out to sea. As the returning waves are squeezed in, they start to move faster and swirl around, carrying you away from shore and into deeper water. Use the above guide\u00a0to learn to stay calm and escape so your day at the beach doesn\u2019t end in tragedy.\n\nIllustrated by Ted Slampyak\n",
