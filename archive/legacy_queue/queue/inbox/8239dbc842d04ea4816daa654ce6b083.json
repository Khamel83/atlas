These are my personal Best Practice suggestions for setting up a MacBook for college students. (and I\u2019d love to hear your tips in the comments)\n\nMacBook are very popular with college students, but a little planning and configuration is required for the best experience. A student moving away to college might be the first time they have full control over their own computing experience: installing apps, protecting their privacy, creating good passwords, avoiding viruses & malware, and backing up their data.\n\nThese are my suggestions for setting up a MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro for any college student to simplify their computing experience.\n\nI tend to be the Apple tech support for my family and friends, and this year I\u2019m sending my own son away to college. Whether you are new to Apple computers, or an experienced Apple power user, these tips will help you with the initial MacBook setup for any college student going away.\n\nNOTE: Most of these tips are good for any MacBook user, but I\u2019ve tailored them specific to college students.\n\nUnlike many of my other infographic designs, this one doesn\u2019t have any numeric data to work with. It\u2019s a How-To informative infographic with step-by-step instructions and suggestions. That makes it a little more text-heavy than I normally like, but in this case I felt it was appropriate.\n",
