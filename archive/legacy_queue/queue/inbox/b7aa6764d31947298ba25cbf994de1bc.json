      "Selection": "Republicans and Democrats criticized Ilhan Omar, the Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota, after she tweeted that Republican support for Israel is linked to cash, particularly from the powerful pro-Israel group AIPAC.\n\nIt's all about the Benjamins baby  https://t.co/KatcXJnZLV\n\n\u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) February 10, 2019\n\nJerry Nadler, the New York Democrat who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, called Omar\u2019s remarks \u201cdeeply disappointing and disturbing\u201d and said she \u201cappears to traffic in old anti-Semitic tropes about Jews and money.\u201d Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said Omar\u2019s \u201cuse of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel\u2019s supporters is deeply offensive.\u2019\n\nAt the same time, some Americans rushed to Omar\u2019s defense. \u201cLobbies influence politics, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s controversial to say,\u201d said Rebecca Vilkomerson, executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace. \u201cIt\u2019s not anti-Semitic to accurately describe something that is completely obvious about the Israeli lobby,\u201d tweeted Brandon Friedman, a former Obama official who heads a public-relations agency whose clients address national security and defense issues.\n\nIn apologizing today (Feb. 11), Omar stood by her view that lobbyists\u2019 money in general plays too big of a role in American politics.\n\nListening and learning, but standing strong  pic.twitter.com/7TSroSf8h1\n\n\u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) February 11, 2019\n\n\u00a0\n\nPro-Israel funding has increased\n\nPro-Israel groups like AIPAC\u2014the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\u2014have been pouring money into US politics over the past 20 years and their influence in Washington has been scrutinized for nearly as long. However, the amount AIPAC has donated has been dwarfed in recent years by the mega-donors Sheldon and Miriam Adelson.\n\nThe Center for Responsive Politics calls the overall pro-Israel politics lobby one of the most \u201cactive and well-financed\u201d groups related to international issues in America: \u201cIt\u2019s a highly fractious issue with high stakes and it plays a big role in domestic politics.\u201d\n\nAmid concerns that former president Barack Obama would be less supportive of Israel, donations by pro-Israel political-action committees jumped in 2008, his first year in office.\n\nIn 2018, these groups (including AIPAC) spent about $5 million on direct lobbying efforts beyond campaign contributions; pro-Saudi groups, for a rough contrast, spent $19 million from the beginning of 2017 until October 2018.\n\nOver the past two federal election cycles, pro-Israel groups have given more to Democrats than Republicans:\n\nThe pro-Israel groups represent a spectrum of political positions, though they are united against the \u201cboycott, divestment, and sanction\u201d campaign started in 2005 to protest Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. (A bill moving through Congress would allow state governments to dump contractors that boycott Israel.)\n\nOne of the top pro-Israel DC lobbying groups in recent years has been JStreetPAC, which is dedicated to \u201ca diplomacy-first approach to advancing US interests in the Middle East and promoting peace and security for Israel,\u201d including a \u201ctwo-state approach\u201d for Israel and Palestine, and continued foreign aid to both. \n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that money often plays a major role in our political system,\u201d J Street said in a statement released today about Omar\u2019s comments. \u201cAt the same time, elected officials must be extremely aware that tropes about Jewish money and political influence have been used for centuries to target and stigmatize our community.\u201d\n\nAIPAC\u2019s political contributions\n\nAIPAC! https://t.co/UdzaFUEfrh\n\n\u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) February 11, 2019\n\nThe powerful lobbying group that Omar referenced has been active in the US since the 1960s, foots the bill for dozens of Congress trips to Israel every year, and was a longtime opponent of the Iran nuclear deal the Obama administration crafted. Along with other groups representing Middle East interests, AIPAC has applauded Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the deal and the reimposition of sanctions on Iran.\n\nAIPAC\u2019s political support is seen as so important that every top 2016 US presidential candidate spoke at the group\u2019s annual convention, from Hillary Clinton to Ted Cruz.\n\nBernie Sanders, the only Jewish candidate in the 2016 race, appeared by video. In a rare move for a US elected official, he offered some criticism of the Israeli government\u2019s policies in his speech, saying, \u201cWhen we talk about Israel and Palestinian areas, it is important to understand that today there is a whole lot of suffering among Palestinians and that cannot be ignored.\u201d Peace, he said, would require compromise from \u201cboth sides.\u201d\n\nThe Adelsons and Israeli American Council\n\nAIPAC\u2019s lobbying and campaign contributions have been much less than the huge influx of cash into US politics from mega-donors Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, who was born in Israel to parents who had emigrated to British-controlled Palestine from Poland in 1930s.\n\nThey were the largest donors in the 2018 midterm elections with $123 million, all of that to Republican political action committees that then funneled millions to incumbents in tough races. Adelson-controlled entities gave $55 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund, for example, which spent $126 million running ads against Democrats such as Wisconsin\u2019s Randy\u201dIronStache\u201d Bryche.\n\nThe Adelsons also fund the Israeli American Council (IAC), a group with 20 chapters around the US that Sheldon Adelson described as a hardline alternative to AIPAC in November 2017. IAC will \u201cunequivocally always without question and irreversibly support Israel when it needed it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no political correctness. There will be no questions about whether we should keep the door to the White House open to us.\u201d\n\nMiriam, a doctor who runs drug-treatment clinics in Las Vegas and Israel, is believed to be a key influence on Trump\u2019s decision to move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a move that most American Jews didn\u2019t support. \u201cInjecting Israeli Jewish sensibilities into the American Jewish body politic is what drives a lot of what the Adelsons fund,\u201d the Times of Israel wrote last year. Sheldon\u2019s casino interests have been advanced by the Trump administration, including lobbying the Japanese government on his behalf for a casino license.\n\nMiriam described how her childhood shaped her views in an interview with Hadassah Magazine in 2014. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any children of my class who were from Europe and had grandparents,\u201d she said. \u201cAll were lost in the Holocaust. There was nobody to spoil us. We grew up knowing our existence depended on a strong army and that everyone around us wanted to invade us. It was important just to survive.\u201d\n",
