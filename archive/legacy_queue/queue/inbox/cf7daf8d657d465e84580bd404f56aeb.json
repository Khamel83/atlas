      "Selection": "Sep. 12, 2017 at 9:53 AM\n\nPoliticians Write Lots Of Books. Here\u2019s How Far Into Them People Read.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s new book, \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d comes out Tuesday and features her reflections on the 2016 election. Whether it\u2019ll enter the pantheon of great campaign memoirs or turn out to be just another post-politics potboiler, \u201cWhat Happened\u201d is by all appearances the first hot political book of the fall.\n\nIt also apparently offers some compelling content, including relitigating internecine fights in the Democratic Party, openly assailing the character of a sitting president and recounting the inside story of one of the most stunning campaign failures in U.S. history. And that, by itself, might distinguish it from the political memoir genre in general. Political books written around a presidential election are usually a mixture of ghostwritten policy proposals slammed together with a series of mediocre pseudo-biographical stories that often backfire on a contender mid-race.These paperweights are defined by long subtitles and the struggle of making a politician a likable protagonist.\n\nBut people still read them. Well, sort of. I was curious how far readers typically make it through these books. I couldn\u2019t get any reading data, but I reached out to Audiobooks.com for listening data on political memoirs by presidential candidates going back to the 2000 election. We focused on books by every \u201cserious\u201d candidate published before or shortly after each presidential election \u2014 \u201cserious\u201d as defined by my colleague Harry Enten back before the 2016 election. (Basically, any candidate who held a major political office before running or got at least a bit of the vote in Iowa or New Hampshire.) Audiobooks.com was able to find the books with more than 10 downloads and sent over the average percentage of the book that listeners sat through.\n\nBefore we get to the data, there are some caveats! If you don\u2019t see a book on here, remember that not all books have an audio version widely available. Moreover, sales for some of these books peaked long before Audiobooks.com began collecting data. Second, if a completion rate number seems low, keep in mind that most people don\u2019t finish reading most things. Most likely, less than half of the people who started this article made it to this sentence. It\u2019s the nature of the game.\n\nWhich political books did listeners stick with?\n\nBy presidential candidates on Audiobooks.com since the 2000 election\n\nAVERAGE\n\nPUB.\u25b2\u25bc\n\nAUTHOR\u25b2\u25bc\n\nTITLE\u25b2\u25bc\n\nLENGTH (HRS)\u25b2\u25bc\n\nSHARE OF BOOK READ\u25b2\u25bc\n\nTIME SPENT LISTENING (HRS)\u25b2\u25bc\n\n2010\n\nGeorge W.

The average reader made it through three-quarters of \u201cFaith of My Fathers\u201d by John McCain. That\u2019s ridiculously high. Marco Rubio, Scott Walker and Mike Huckabee all had average completion percentages, between 65 and 70 percent, for \u201cAmerican Dreams,\u201d \u201cUnintimidated,\u201d and \u201cGod, Guns, Grits, and Gravy,\u201d respectively. The books that don\u2019t do so well by this measure come from both sides of the aisle, but they do have one thing in common: They\u2019re looooong.\n\nSo the other way to gauge who\u2019s written the most engaging political books is to look at how much time listeners are spending with them. (The right-most column.) We can use the average amount of time spent listening to a book \u2014 completion percentage multiplied by book length \u2014 which doesn\u2019t penalize books for being lengthier. In this case, \u201cDecision Points,\u201d the presidential memoir by President George W. Bush, \u201cHard Choices,\u201d the 2014 memoir by Hillary Clinton, and \u201cA Time for Truth\u201d by Ted Cruz come out looking very good. It turns out that people are willing to listen to Bush, Clinton and Cruz speak uninterrupted for many more hours than I expected. Seriously, the fact that George W. Bush is not only an accomplished author but perhaps the most successful author in his field (at least by one metric) is not a notion I would have even entertained before I started digging into this. Well done, Dubs.\n\nWhat about the books that listeners barely made a dent in? Second from the bottom is \u201cGreat Again: How to Fix Our Crippled America\u201d by President Trump, and in last place is \u201cIt Takes a Village,\u201d a slimmed-down version of a 1996 Hillary Clinton volume that was later turned into a picture book.\n",
