      "Title": "Theresa May is schooling Donald Trump on how to respond to Islamophobia Vox - All",
      "Selection": "They were just trying to pray in peace.\n\nLate Sunday night, Muslim worshippers celebrating Ramadan at London\u2019s Finsbury Park Mosque exited services onto the nearby Seven Sisters Road. A white van careened off the street and slammed into the crowd, killing one and injuring at least eight others. The driver, a 48-year-old white man, reportedly yelled, \u201cI want to kill all Muslims\u201d before he was apprehended by members of the crowd he attacked.\n\nAfterward, all eyes turned to UK Prime Minister Theresa May. Earlier this month, jihadists killed eight in an attack on London Bridge that also involved a van ramming pedestrians. After that attack, May said that there was \u201cfar too much tolerance\u201d of \u201cIslamist extremism\u201d in the UK and called for civil liberties restrictions (like limits on free speech online) in response. Would her response be as aggressive when Muslims were the victims rather than the perpetrators?\n\nYes, as it turns out \u2014 it was.\n\n\"This was an attack on Muslims near their place of worship and, like all terrorism in whatever form, it shares the same fundamental goal,\" she said. \"It is a reminder that terrorism, extremism, and hatred take many forms, and our determination to tackle them must be the same whoever is responsible.\u201d\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May announces new commission for countering extremism in wake of #FinsburyPark attack https://t.co/if2uFwOLPo http://pic.twitter.com/FFMa497o1k\n\u2014 CNN International (@cnni) June 19, 2017\n\n\u201cExcellent and powerful statement from Theresa May on Finsbury Park,\u201d tweeted Brendan Cox, an anti-hate activist whose wife, Jo Cox, a Labour member of Parliament, was murdered last year by a right-wing, anti-Muslim extremist.\n\nCox also noticed something else. Donald Trump, who immediately condemned the London Bridge attack and used it to argue for his controversial travel ban, has yet to comment to the attack in Finsbury Park.\n\n. @realDonaldTrump I fear u may have missed it but there was a terror attack last night in London on Muslims. Looking fwd to yr condemnation\n\u2014 Brendan Cox (@MrBrendanCox) June 19, 2017\n\nTrump still has not tweeted on the matter. It took until late on Monday afternoon for the White House to offer any statement, saying that \"thoughts and prayers go out to our British allies.\" \n\nThere\u2019s a lesson here: a lesson on how a normal leader handles hate crimes, and how Donald J. Trump does it. \n\nTheresa May is hardly a champion of inclusion\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that May is not historically a champion for the rights of Britain\u2019s Muslim minority.\n\nMay was home secretary, a position responsible for (among other things) internal security, prior to becoming prime minister. During that time, she championed something called the Prevent program \u2014 a counter-extremism program introduced in 2003 that had been heavily criticized for singling out Muslims for police attention. In 2011, May introduced a plan for the program to focus on \u201cextremist ideology,\u201d an idea that experts have criticized as dangerously vague.\n\n\u201cThe Home Secretary does fail to identify what the terms \u2018extremism\u2019 and \u2018radicalisation\u2019 actually mean, or provide any robust research or insights as to who might be an \u2018extremist,\u201d Brian Blakemore, an expert on UK homeland security policy at the University of South Wales, wrote at the time. \u201cThe problem with this lack of detail is the potential to profile \u2026 the police could use their powers of investigation to arrest innocent Muslims purely because of their ethnicity, name, and religion.\u201d\n\nPrevent hasn\u2019t changed very much since May became prime minister last year. This led Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, a member of May\u2019s Conservative Party who served as minister for faith and communities while May was home secretary, to publicly criticize the prime minister in a recent interview with the UK Times. Warsi called Prevent \u201ctoxic,\u201d adding, \u201cI think Theresa May needs to pause, she needs to reassess what Prevent is about.\u201d She linked this to a broader problem with anti-Muslim sentiment in the UK.\n\n\"I think Islamophobia is Britain's bigotry blind spot,\u201d Warsi said. \u201cI would like a prime minister or home secretary to stand up and say, \u2018We all want to fight the war on terror, but Muslims are not fair game.\u2019\"\n\nSunday night\u2019s attack in Finsbury Park was the acid test as to whether Theresa May would be able to follow through on Warsi\u2019s challenge. If you can\u2019t condemn anti-Muslim hatred after it claimed the life of one of your citizens, when could you ever?\n\nBut May passed the test.\n\n\u201cThis extremism every bit as insidious and destructive to our values and our way of life [as jihadism],\u201d she said after the Finsbury Park Mosque attack. \u201cThere has been far too much tolerance of extremism \u2026 and that means extremism of any kind including Islamophobia.\u201d\n\nThis is the bare minimum of what you could expect from a leader in this position. May, a champion of controversial and arguably discriminatory counterterrorism policies, still managed to come out and publicly condemn attacks on Muslim worshippers as harshly as she had condemned attacks committed by Muslims.\n\nIt\u2019s a bar that Trump can\u2019t ever seem to clear. \n\nContrast May with Trump\n\n(Getty Images)\n\nWhile Trump jumps at any report of suspected Islamist terrorism \u2014 even ones that haven\u2019t been confirmed \u2014 he usually takes days to mention attacks on Muslims if he mentions them at all. The Washington Post\u2019s Philip Bump lists two examples:\n\nIt took days for him to praise the two men who were stabbed to death in Portland while defending Muslim women on a train. It took almost a week for him to speak out about the shooting of two Indian men in Kansas by someone who thought that they were Muslim. In one sense, it\u2019s odd that Trump hasn\u2019t tweeted condolences to the victims in London, given the criticism he\u2019s received for his slow response to the above attacks \u2014 but, again, it\u2019s not surprising that he hasn\u2019t, given that history.\n\nBump\u2019s cases are particularly telling because they were in the United States. Trump can\u2019t seem to get interested in Islamophobic terrorist attacks inside America\u2019s borders, yet the \u201cAmerica first\u201d president jumps at opportunities to highlight reports of Islamist violence in places like Britain and the Philippines.\n\nThe reason why is fairly obvious.\n\nAttacks targeting Muslims do nothing for Trump\u2019s political agenda, and don\u2019t fit into his worldview (which positions Islam principally a source of violence). When Muslims commit attacks, by contrast, Trump can use that as a justification for his policies singling out Muslims \u2014 most notably the travel ban targeting individuals from Muslim countries.\n\n\u201cThe idea of Muslims being victimized doesn't fit his domestic or foreign policy agenda,\u201d Shahed Amanullah, an Obama-era State Department official, told my Vox colleague Sarah Wildman. \u201cHe doesn't even respond to something like Portland with basic humanity, both because Muslims are not a core constituency and because it interrupts his narrative of Muslims being a threat.\u201d\n\nThe reaction to the two London attacks, then, are emblematic of Trump\u2019s real concerns. He\u2019s not concerned with political violence or terrorism in general \u2014 the fact that people are being murdered in the name of extremist ideology. He\u2019s only concerned with violence that comes from a specific group that espouses a specific strain of extremist ideology. \n\nWhich is precisely why we\u2019re not hearing calls to ban white Britons from entering the United States until Trump can \u201cfigure out what\u2019s going on.\u201d Violence committed by anyone other than Muslims just doesn\u2019t seem to be on Trump\u2019s radar.
