      "Title": "The five biggest lies you tell yourself before giving a presentation Quartz",
      "Selection": "In most of life, you can screw up without drawing too much attention to yourself. This isn\u2019t the case when you\u2019re giving a presentation. All eyes are on you, judging you, and if you do a terrible job, all of them will notice. Right. Away.\n\nIt\u2019s natural to respond to this brutal vulnerability by talking yourself into giving a terrible presentation. But you want to give a good presentation, so when you hear yourself say these five things, you need to talk back.\n\n\u201cThis is how it\u2019s always done\u201d\n\nAnd has that worked? If so, can you say that Now is as it\u2019s always been? If you have a Yes to both questions, carry on. Buy a lottery ticket on the way home.\n\n\u201cIf my presentation is long, people will know I work hard\u201d\n\nDoes length work for other people when you watch them? If you\u2019re in a culture that needs you to show your work, consider this question: Are there other ways to demonstrate that you work hard while making a shorter presentation? For example, could you include a slide up front that lists all of the activities that got you to your point or offer a longhand document with all the workings?\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t let go of all the information\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re addicted. And here\u2019s the thing, you aren\u2019t letting go of everything altogether, you\u2019re just being selective about how it shows up. You can print out all the information and sleep with it if you need the company. But you want the more important information to shine and not get drowned out by the noise of all the information.\n\n\u201cIf I use big words, people will think it\u2019s more important\u201d\n\nYes, but will they understand it? Will the people they\u2019ll ask to help you understand it? At some point your thinking will leave the building\u2014will people outside the building understand your points as you\u2019ve phrased them?\n\n\u201cUsing uncommon words makes me feel vulnerable\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re standing in front of people, believing in something, and asking them to enlist in your point, you\u2019re already vulnerable. Yes, being creative is an act of deviance, and even though humans are wired for creativity, presenting ourselves in new ways makes us feel vulnerable because we fear rejection from the tribe. You\u2019re vulnerable anyway, you\u2019re a human. So, as you write, ask yourself: Is there a shorter, sharper word for this?\n\nOur brains are tricksters, and mental blocks are their weapons. When you catch yourself in the throes of another automated presentation, you must stop and give your brain some lip. Talk back to it. Trick it. Stand up for yourself and your ideas. If you can only handle one question and one jolt to your automatic tendencies, ask this: What\u2019s one thing we can do differently this time? By the tenth presentation\u2026 hang on, you just did math ahead of me\u2026 yes, you\u2019ll have done ten things differently, and a new approach will have emerged from the fires of presentation hell.\n\nThis article is part of a Quartz series on how to make \u201cpointy\u201d presentations.\n\nMark Pollard is the CEO at Mighty Jungle, a brand strategy agency in New York.\n",
