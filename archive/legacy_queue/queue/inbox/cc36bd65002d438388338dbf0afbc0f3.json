      "Selection": "Chris, a loyal MR reader, writes to me:\n\nI\u2019ve been turning to your insights on prizes vs. grants over the years. Your Google talk from 2007 is without question the best discussion I\u2019ve found of their respective merits\u2026I was wondering if your thinking on prizes vs. grants has evolved, and in particular [TC has added the numbers here]:\n\n1. In the Google talk, you talked about an equilibrium in which there would be a growing ecosystem of big prizes complementing one another. I\u2019m not sure it has turned out this way. Do you agree, and what happened? Did the \u201cfailure\u201d of some high profile prizes (e.g. the Google Lunar XPrize) dampen down the enthusiasm?\n\n2. More generally, there seemed to be an expectation in the 2000s and early 2010s that prizes would take off and become a more significant feature of the R&D funding landscape. Again, I don\u2019t think that has really happened. What explains that?\n\n3. Looking specifically at government funding of R&D, do you think there is an equilibrium in which grants can coexist with prizes? Or do grants squeeze out prizes through some form of adverse selection (the best researchers opting for grants over prizes)?\n\n4. How important do you think public choice reasons are for us being in a grant-dominated equilibrium? It seems that the science sector has done a great job of positioning itself as something other than an interest group, with its interests squarely aligned with the public good. (Even suggesting that the science sector is also\u00a0an interest group seems slightly heretical. It\u2019s interesting that Dominic Cummings, for all his radicalism, seems to see little need for any reform of the science/research ecosystem beyond ARPA).\n\nFirst a general remark: I now see the current scientific (and cultural) establishment as having more implicit prizes than I used to realize.\u00a0 In fact, getting a grant is one of the biggest prizes you can receive, if the grant is sufficiently prestigious.\u00a0 By an \u201cimplicit prizes,\u201d I mean a prize where the target achievement is not quite spelled out, but if \u201cwe\u201d (however defined) judge you to have achieved enough, we will pour grants, status, and high quality social networks into your lap.\u00a0 For instance, Alex and I have received significant \u201cprizes\u201d for writing MR, although none of those prizes have names or bring explicit public recognition, as opposed to general recognition.\u00a0 We have in contrast never received a grant to write MR, so are prizes really so under-provided?\n\nSo my current thinking is a bit less \u201cgrants vs. prizes,\u201d and somewhat more \u201cimplicit prizes vs. explicit prizes, each combined with grants to varying degrees.\u201d\u00a0 Implicit prizes are more flexible, but they also are easier to cheat with, since the standard of achievement is never quite clear.\u00a0 Implicit prizes also are much more valuable to people who can use, build, and exploit their social networks, and of course that is not everyone (but shouldn\u2019t we be giving more prizes to those people?).\u00a0 Implicit prizes also can be revoked through subsequent loss of status.\u00a0 Implicit prizes are more likely \u201cgranted\u201d by the hands of social networks rather than judging panels, all of those features being both cost and benefit.\n\nNow to the specific points:\n\n1. As the venture capital ecosystem grows, and as the value of publicity rises (it is easier to monetize scientific and other sources of fame), and there are more \u201cinfluencers in the broad sense,\u201d there are more implicit prizes to be had.\u00a0 And did the Lunar XPrize fail?\u00a0 If an end is not worth accomplishing, a prize is one way to find that out.\n\n2. In addition to my point about the proliferation of implicit prizes, the scientific, academic, and political communities are far too conservative in the literal sense of that word.\u00a0 How many top schools experiment with different tenure procedures?\u00a0 Different ways of running a department?\u00a0 It is sad how difficult it is to experiment with changes in academia and science, whether the topic be prizes or not.\n\n3. The best researchers get both grants and prizes (one hopes).\n\nBy the way, here is a recent piece on the empirics of prizes, mostly positive results.\n\nThe post How has my thinking on prizes vs. grants evolved? appeared first on Marginal REVOLUTION.\n",
