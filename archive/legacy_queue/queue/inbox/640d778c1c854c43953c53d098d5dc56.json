We recommend that you use Google Flights to find dates to fly, then book through an online travel agency, such as Orbitz or Expedia, which allows you to cancel flights without penalty by 11pm Eastern Time within one day of booking. However, if you\u2019re using the American Express Platinum Card, you\u2019ll need to book directly with the airline or through Amex Travel portal to get 5x MR points. Remember: Fares may disappear quickly, so book right away and take advantage of Orbitz or Expedia\u2019s courtesy cancellation if you\u2019re unable to get the time away from work or family.\n\nHere\u2019s a great chance to visit the New York Times\u2019 top destination of 2016\u00a0\u2014 for less.
