      "Title": "Ventana Big Sur Hyatt. Bottom Line Review Awesome Frequent Miler",
      "Selection": "Ventana Big Sur is an adults-only resort in Big Sur California.\u00a0 Ventana is part of Hyatt\u2019s Alila luxury brand and currently the only Alila property in the United States (although a second Alila is being developed in Encinatas, north of San Diego).\u00a0 We stayed four nights in early March and paid 30,000 points per night.\u00a0 A friend with Globalist status booked our stay for us as a Guest of Honor reservation.\u00a0 This gave us all of the perks of top-tier Globalist status during the stay (free breakfast, suite upgrade, etc.).\u00a0 Cash rates at Ventana are often over $1,000 per night, but rates were under $600 per night during our stay.\u00a0 Even then, 30,000 points per night resulted in very good value for our points especially when considering that we didn\u2019t have to pay resort fees (Hyatt doesn\u2019t charge resort fees on award bookings).\n\nVentana Big Sur Bottom Line Review\n\nWow.\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 Did I say \u201cwow\u201d?\u00a0 Wow.\n\nMy wife and I loved everything about Ventana.\u00a0 The property itself is beautiful.\u00a0 The surrounding area (Big Sur) is fantastic.\u00a0 Our suite was awesome.\u00a0 We plan to return often.\n\nThis is not the place to go if you want to play golf or tennis.\u00a0 You won\u2019t find those options here.\u00a0 This is not a place to bring kids \u2014 it\u2019s adults only.\u00a0 This is a place to relax, to enjoy nature at its most beautiful, and to bring your dog \u2014 dogs are welcome here.\n\nPoints Price: Category 7, 30,000 points per night standard, 25,000 off-peak, or 35,000 peak\n\nPoint value: Excellent.\u00a0 Base rooms often cost over $1,000 per night, so even at peak award pricing you\u2019ll often get 3 cents per point value or more.\n\nLocation: Excellent.\u00a0 Big Sur is a gorgeous area.\u00a0 The drive itself, along highway 1 is breathtaking.\n\nResort Dining: Excellent.\u00a0 Breakfast was very good and the ocean view when seated outside was incredible.\u00a0 We ate dinner at the resort restaurant (The Sur House) once, and it was fantastic.\n\nRoom: We were upgraded to the Vista Hot Tub Suite.\u00a0 It was a huge one-room suite with a very large and private rear patio featuring nature views and, of course, a hot tub. We loved everything about the suite.\n\nComplementary Activities:\n\nMorning Yoga and Tai chi (we didn\u2019t do either)\n\nGuided property hike daily at 10 am (this was very good)\n\nCocktails and snacks daily from 4 to 5 (loved this)\n\nPet friendly: We didn\u2019t bring a pet, but there were many dogs on property and they seemed very happy.\n\nService: Excellent\n\nTurn-down service? Yes, daily turn-down service included delicious chocolates.\n\nResort fee: $50 per day, includes valet parking.\u00a0 Keep in mind that Hyatt doesn\u2019t charge resort fees on award stays, so we didn\u2019t have to pay this.\u00a0 Those with top-tier Globalist status don\u2019t pay on resort fees on paid stays either.\n\nMisc:\n\nWelcome gift: We had notified the resort ahead of time that we would be celebrating a major anniversary and so they delivered a bottle of Prosecco and chocolate covered strawberries.\n\nNo phone service for me: I can\u2019t remember the last time I went four straight days with no phone signals.\u00a0 I use Google Fi which is on T-Mobile\u2019s network.\u00a0 T-mobile seems to have given Big Sur a hard pass.\u00a0 My wife had service most of the time via AT&T.\n\nHyatt Elite Benefits: Excellent\u2026\n\nWe were upgraded to a suite the day before check-in (we could see the room assignment through the Hyatt app)\n\nBreakfast was free, up to $82 per day, either at the Sur House restaurant or for in-room dining.\u00a0 If the weather is good, I highly recommend going to the Sur House.\n\nThe desk agent proactively told us that we were eligible for 4pm late checkout (but we didn\u2019t need it since we had a plane to catch).\n\nWould I stay again?\u00a0 Duh.\n\nPhotos and captions follow\u2026\n\nVista Hot Tub Suite. As you can see, our room was enormous. In the far corner you\u2019ll spot a wood burning fireplace.\n\nVista Hot Tub Suite. My wife and I enjoyed the wood burning fireplace every evening.\u00a0 Ventana stocks each room with firewood held in flammable bags.\u00a0 Simply stick the bag into the fireplace and light it.\u00a0 Done.\n\nVista Hot Tub Suite rear patio. Even though there were units on each side of us, the patio was designed to be completely private (if you don\u2019t count the deer that occasionally peeked at us).\n\n\u00a0\n\nDeer peeking at us from ridge\n\nAnother view of the Vista Hot Tub Suite rear patio. You can see the bathroom soaking tub through the window on the right.\u00a0 The furthest right window is the bathroom shower.\n\nVista Hot Tub Suite soaking tub and shower. The shower was stocked with home-made (I think?) exfoliating bar soap. We loved this.\n\nView from path near our suite.\n\nThe Ventana\u2019s restaurant is a short walk through Redwood trees. They\u2019ll alternatively drive you there on a golf cart, but come on\u2026 this was a fantastic little walk each morning!\n\nBreakfast at the Ventana\u2019s Sur House Restaurant.\n\nAnother view of breakfast dining at the Sur House.\n\nGlass House Gallery next to the Sur House restaurant.\n\nRedwood Trees!\n\nVentana also offers Glamping tents like this one. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an option to use points for these at this time though.\n\nThe post Ventana Big Sur Hyatt. Bottom Line Review: Awesome appeared first on Frequent Miler.\n",
