      "Selection": "A Billionaire Makes a Classic Investing Error\nConcentrating in a single asset class can be an invitation to trouble.\nBloomberg, May 3, 2018\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nI try to avoid giving unsolicited advice to billionaires. They are doing just fine without me. Besides, nobody likes to hear from the cheap seats, especially when they just made a terrible, horrible, reckless investing error that poses unnecessary risk and could cost quite literally billions of dollars.\n\nI bring this up after I read this headline, \u201cThis Billionaire Has Put Half His Net Worth Into Gold,\u201d on Bloomberg News and the story that went with it. It describes a very concentrated investing bet:\n\nSome big investors see warning signs ahead for markets but are holding their positions. Egyptian billionaire\u00a0Naguib Sawiris\u00a0is taking action: He\u2019s put half of his $5.7 billion net worth into gold.\n\nHe said in an interview Monday that he believes gold prices will rally further, reaching $1,800 per ounce from just above $1,300 now, while \u201covervalued\u201d stock markets crash.\n\nSome big investors see warning signs ahead for markets but are holding their positions. Egyptian billionaire\u00a0Naguib Sawiris\u00a0is taking action: He\u2019s put half of his $5.7 billion net worth into gold.\n\nThe billionaire in question, who is buying gold directly and investing in gold miners, is No. 338 on the Bloomberg\u00a0Billionaires Index\u00a0and comes from the wealthiest family in Egypt. His father, Onsi Sawiris, is also a billionaire who established Orascom Group. Naguib\u2019s youngest brother is the richest man in Egypt.\n\nContinues at A Billionaire Makes a Classic Investing Error\n\n\u00a0\n",
