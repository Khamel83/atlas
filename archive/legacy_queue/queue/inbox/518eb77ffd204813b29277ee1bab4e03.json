In my interview, I told my future boss that I had never been able to imagine an idea that could be best expressed by painting it. \u201cBut,\u201d I added, making exaggerated eye contact, \u201cappreciating art doesn\u2019t mean you can send effective emails. I can write. I can make your job easier for you.\u201d This is the best thing to say in an interview if you are young and unqualified to do anything other than maintain a personal blog. I started three weeks later.\n",
