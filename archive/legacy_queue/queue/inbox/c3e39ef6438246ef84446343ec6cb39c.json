      "Selection": "I met my husband at a TGI Friday\u2019s. You might not think that novelty license plates and mozzarella cheese sticks are the stuff romantic dreams are made of. But within a few days, I was wearing an engagement ring.\n\nI thought to myself, This is completely nuts. Three months later, as I took my dad\u2019s arm and walked down the aisle, I was still thinking the same thing.\n\nYet now, after 10 years of marriage, I\u2019m convinced our short engagement and modest wedding were eminently reasonable. Or at least as sensible as it\u2019s possible to be when you\u2019re deliciously in love.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to be said for a slapdash wedding. The average engagement lasts 14 months, according to a 2014 survey published in The Knot. That\u2019s a lot of time to devote to wedding planning\u2014time that some people might prefer to spend focusing on getting a master\u2019s degree or writing a book.\n\nAmong my 20- and 30-something peers, explicitly lavish weddings aren\u2019t on trend. Instead, couples go in for celebrations that feel rustic and homey. But the homespun aesthetic belies the hours of effort that go into potting your own succulent centerpieces and tying gingham ribbons around all those mason-jar lanterns. And so many couples wind up drinking bespoke cocktails of anxiety and stress for a year or more, all in the service of a party that lasts a total of five hours.\n\nSpending a lot of money on a wedding doesn\u2019t augur a lasting union, either. In fact, spending more than $20,000 is correlated with higher divorce rates. As The Atlantic says, \u201cA strong marriage \u2026 is an intentional one\u201d but \u201cexpensive rings and ceremonies don\u2019t yield happier unions.\u201d\n\n\u00a0In truth, every time a couple ties the knot, they should be telling themselves, \u201cThis thing is so crazy it just might work.\u201d\u00a0In this light, what is arguably completely nuts is the huge expense and tedious attention to detail that American culture encourages people to put into celebrating a union with a 40-50% percent likelihood of failure. In truth, every time a couple ties the knot, they should be telling themselves, \u201cThis thing is so crazy it just might work.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: I love weddings, fancy, homey and everything in between. I have been to a rehearsal dinner held on the family yacht, and to a laid-back reception at a state park that involved little more than shelter and potato salad. Few other celebrations in our lives match a wedding\u2019s joyful diversity. When else do you get to share a dance floor with toddlers, grandmas, college classmates and burgeoning, ill-advised hookups? At a wedding, you get to embrace every stage of human life.\n\nWhat I deplore is the pressure surrounding weddings\u2014brought on in no small part by the wedding-industrial complex. While reliable numbers are hard to find, survey data from TheKnot.com suggests the average wedding cost now clocks in at $32,641, just about the average down payment on a house in the US. XO Group, which owns TheKnot.com, estimates that the \u201cspend associated with weddings\u2026 totals over $70 billion annually.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just wedding magazines, caterers and J. Crew catalogues convincing us that we need to pour at least a year\u2019s worth of energy and resources into planning a single day\u2019s celebrations. We\u2019re living through a Cambrian explosion of wedding imagery. Between Facebook and Instagram, we witness every one of our friends and acquaintances\u2019 weddings, complete with exquisitely garlanded barns and video shot by drones, whether we attend or not.\n\n\u00a0I adore the brides and grooms who, in the face of all that pressure, display what is known as chill.\u00a0Turn on the TV and there\u2019s Say Yes to the Dress and Bridezillas, which normalize the idea that weddings are necessarily high-stress affairs that would be incomplete without shouting matches in the dressing room and fistfights in the parking lot. Check out the news, and the New York Times\u2019 Vows column suggests that a great wedding involves a 16-page illustrated pamphlet, 15 different musical pieces and a family lodge complete with a \u201cwedding meadow.\u201d\n\nIt all adds up to a ridiculous amount of pressure on a couple. So I adore the brides and grooms who, in the face of it all, display what is known as chill.\n\nI think of my friend Jen. When I asked her how she met her husband Mark, she said, \u201cWe both worked part time for an events company and ended up being assigned to the same hole at a charity golf tournament. We had a few hours to kill, so we fell in love.\u201d Engaged for just a few months, they reserved a tiny-house chapel and found a field in which to park it. She bought a $120 dress online. Total spend? Less than $1,000.\n\nGranted, Jen had been married before, but I\u2019ve heard plenty of similar stories from first-timers. My friend Mary got married at her summer camp. \u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t a traditional venue, they made an exception for us and it didn\u2019t cost anything,\u201d she said. She and her husband made playlists for the wedding on Spotify, got flowers from Costco, and brought their own booze. \u201cThe big-ticket item was catering,\u201d she said. \u201cMy lace dress was full of twigs by the end of the day.\u201d\n\nAnother friend, Danny, and his then-girlfriend Yuka (who is Japanese) made a spur-of-the-moment decision to get hitched in the face of a $5,000 legal bill for work on her immigration to the US. \u201cI realized I didn\u2019t want to waste money on lawyers,\u201d Danny told me. \u201cI just want to get married or whatever. I wanted to have a kid and buy an apartment.\u201d\n\nSix days later, they were wed at the city clerk\u2019s office in Manhattan\u2014an especially festive place at the time because it was the week gay marriage was legalized in New York. Afterward, they went to brunch at Les Halles, and a coworker picked up the check. Then they went for a bike ride and ended up at the movies. (\u201cThe only movie available at the time we wanted was Horrible Bosses,\u201d Danny adds. \u201cIt was supposed to be a comedy but it was not great.\u201d)\n\nThey put the money they saved on legal fees toward a down payment on a co-op. Now they\u2019ve got the apartment and the kid\u2014their daughter, Chiara, is almost four years old\u2014they hoped for.\n\nWhat I love about these stories is each couple\u2019s refreshing lack of rigidity and pretension, their joyful practicality. There can be real sense of freedom in bypassing all the red tape and hassle.\n\nOf course, if a couple wants to put some serious planning into a bash for friends and family, that\u2019s absolutely their prerogative. But I do wish more people felt like they had the option of starting off their marriage in whatever way they want. Perhaps the best way to combat the pressure to plan a traditional wedding is to encourage people to share tales of their scrappy, haphazard paths to marriage\u2013an antidote to the world of expensive tulle gowns, elaborate hand-crafted centerpieces, and other features that supposedly signal the weighty import of the wedding day.\n\n\u00a0The next morning, I wasn\u2019t sure whether I was really engaged or not. My mind screeched: How can that be something you don\u2019t know?\u00a0In my own experience, at least, happy marriages often follow from humble beginnings. The fateful night I went to the TGI Friday\u2019s, I did not have great expectations for the evening. (Who would?) I was there on an awkward, nearly silent Craigslist date. I\u2019d recently been dumped by my college boyfriend and was so heartbroken I\u2019d moved back in with my parents in my hometown. As far as I was concerned, life couldn\u2019t get much worse.\n\nThen my old high-school boyfriend, Chris, walked in. I nearly ducked under the table. He and I hadn\u2019t spoken in at least four years. But two nights later, he called to say that we should hang out. We got a drink, and afterward, he showed me around the little house he\u2019d just bought. We were sitting on his couch, nursing another beer, when he asked me, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\nI said the first thing that came to mind. \u201cI think we should get married.\u201d He said that he thought so too, pulled me onto his lap, and we kissed for about a million years.\n\nThen I drove home to my parents\u2019 house. The next morning, I woke up and I wasn\u2019t sure whether I was really engaged or not. My mind screeched: How can that be something you don\u2019t know?\n\nSo I sent him a text: \u201cI still love you this morning.\u201d\n\nA second later, he texted back: \u201cI still love you every morning.\u201d\n\nI walked downstairs, told my parents, and my mom started ordering the invitations. Three months and about $13,000 later, I was hitched. We had a lovely day, sure. But it was just a wedding.\n\nWe welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com.\n",
