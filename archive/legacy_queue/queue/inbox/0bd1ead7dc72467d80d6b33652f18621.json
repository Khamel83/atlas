      "Selection": "Sorry, this deal is no longer available.\u00a0 Do you want to be alerted about new deals as they\u2019re published?\u00a0 Click here to subscribe to Frequent Miler's Quick Deals.\n\nTalk about saving the best for last: if you still have the ability to get 20% via either of the 2 Amex Membership Rewards promotions, you can get a monster deal.\u00a0I can\u2019t take credit for this discovery \u2014 a reader commented on my post from late last night / early this morning, and it seemed good enough to share as all of the best Amazon deals can be maximized for a further discount\u00a0by adding an Amazon gift card to make up the difference between the \u201coriginal\u201d price and $500, thereby netting a full $100 discount.\n\nAs an example, let\u2019s look at the\u00a0Apple version of the\u00a0Bose noise-cancelling headphones that we posted last night. As you can see, the \u201coriginal\u201d price is $279 (the \u201cprice\u201d under the list price):\n\nAs we noted last night, the 20% off that you can get by paying with 1 Amex Membership Rewards point\u00a0(if you aren\u2019t eligible for that promotion, see the section titled \u201cSecond 20% off promo\u201d below) is\u00a0taking 20% off of the original $279 and subtracting it from the\u00a0sale price of $125.\n\n20% of $279 = $55.80\n$125 (sale price) \u2013 $55.80 = $69.20\n\nAnd that\u2019s how it comes up in the cart:\n\nHowever, reader Larry figured out how to make this deal\u00a0much hotter. Remember that the 20% off promo works on an order size\u00a0up to $500 \u2014 you can get a max discount of $100. As Amazon is figuring the discount based on the \u201coriginal\u201d price of the headphones, Larry figured out that if you add an Amazon gift card worth the difference between the original price and $500, you\u2019ll get a total discount of $100.\n\nIn other words, $500 (max order for discount) \u2013 $279 (original price of headphones) = $221. If you add a $221 Amazon gift card to your card, you\u2019ll get a total of\u00a0$100 off. Start off by adding the headphones (Apple version) to your cart plus a $221 Amazon gift card.\n\nThis is what your cart will look like.\n\nWhen you go to checkout and apply at least 1 Membership Rewards point either using the original promotion or the new promotion (more below), this is what your total will look like:\n\nThat\u2019s a total of\u00a0$247.99. For $247.99, you get:\n\nA\u00a0$221 Amazon gift card\n\nthe\u00a0Bose QuietComfort 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones\n\nAnd if you stack with the Quick Deal that Stephen posted earlier (See: New Amazon Amex Offer: Earn 3x Membership Rewards), you\u2019ll also earn 744 Membership Rewards points. Now that\u2019s a steal. If you were to value the Amazon Gift Card at face value, that would mean a net cost of\u00a0$27 for the headphones. An Amazon gift card isn\u2019t the same as cash that can be spent anywhere, but if you\u2019re an Amazon Prime member, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s pretty close in value to you.\n\nThat same technique works on tons of other items. Here is the Sonos One with a total of\u00a0$301 in gift cards ($50 as part of the bundle + $251 added to hit the $500 mark) for\u00a0$353.91.\n\nThat speaker alone normally sells for $199. Getting that\u00a0plus $301 in gift cards for $353 is an awesome deal.\n\nThis works for tons of the other good deals we\u2019ve posted. As a reminder, here are some of them. Do the math on adding a gift card to the \u201coriginal prices\u201d crossed out below to hit $500 and trigger the full $100 discount. Some of them become really awesome \u2014 though note that some may no longer be available.\n\nOculus Rift + Touch Virtual Reality System:\u00a0Original price $399\u00a0Prime Day sale price: $349\u00a0Final price:\u00a0$269.20\n\nRobot Roomba 671 Robot Vacuum With Wi-Fi:\u00a0Original price $349.99\u00a0Prime Day sale price: $229.99\u00a0Final price:\u00a0$159.99\u00a0with inflated 20% off (We have another 600-series model.

I own one of these (resold a quantity of them). It\u2019s not\u00a0perfect, but it\u2019s not bad. As I was typing this, I got up to pour a glass from a bottle I first tapped about two weeks ago and it tastes perfectly good. I haven\u2019t gotten the claimed\u00a0months\u00a0out of a bottle, but neither am I storing in the correct conditions. At this price, I think it\u2019s worth it if you prefer not to drink an entire bottle in one sitting. This is a better price than what I was stacking when I was reselling them).\n\nSegway miniPRO Smart Self Balancing Transporter 2018 Edition, 12.5 Mile Range, 10 MPH of Top Speed, 10.5-Inch Pneumatic Air Filled Tires, Mobile App Control, Customizable LED Lights:\u00a0Original price $499.99\u00a0Prime Day Sale Price $399.99\u00a0Final Price: $299.99\u00a0(I own one of these and one of the Xiaomi-branded Ninebot. They are a\u00a0ton\u00a0of fun. We ride them on an old rail trail and they handle the bumps just fine and we live in the mountains and they handle hills without an issue. When our son really won\u2019t fall asleep for a nap, my wife puts him in the stroller and pushes him down the rail trail with this and he falls asleep almost without fail. The Segway-branded version at $299.99 is a very good deal.).\n\nLG V35 ThinQ \u2013 64 GB \u2013 Unlocked (AT&T/T-Mobile/Verizon) \u2013 Aurora Black:\u00a0Original price: $899.99\u00a0Prime Day sale price: $599.99\u00a0Final price\u00a0$499.99\n\nAll-new Sonos One with 50 Dollar Amazon Gift Card \u2013 Smart Speaker with Alexa voice control built-in:\u00a0Original price $249\u00a0Prime Day Sale Price $199\u00a0Final price:\u00a0$149.20\n\nThere are lots of other possibilities.\n\nSecond 20% off promo\n\nAs we reported last night, Dan\u2019s Deals\u00a0notes that there is a\u00a0second\u00a0Amex promotion for 20% off that is separate from the one we wrote about a week ago. This one requires you to pay with at least 1 Membership Rewards point\u00a0and\u00a0add coupon code\u00a0AMEXSWP20PD. Word is that this deal\u00a0may\u00a0work for people who maxed out the previous 20% off promo and/or\u00a0may\u00a0work for those who weren\u2019t targeted for that one. There\u2019s no guarantee \u2014 but it\u2019s worth a shot.\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you are still eligible for either of these promotions and you value Amazon gift cards anywhere near cash, adding a gift card to hit the max discount looks like the best deal yet.
