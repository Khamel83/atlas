      "Title": "A shoplifting solution billed as enlightened was ruled to be \u201ctextbook extortion\u201d Quartz",
      "Selection": "Big retailers, like Walmart, have a massive shoplifting problem. The company loses about $3 billion, or about 1% of its annual sales, every year to theft. Police across the country are overwhelmed by the volume of daily phone calls from local Walmart stores.\n\nIn 2016, the retailer came up with a solution. It hired two companies that would target the problem using education programs billed as \u201crestorative justice,\u201d a philosophy that addresses the community harm in a given crime, and avoids being unnecessarily punitive.\n\nThe practices of one of these providers, the Corrective Education Company (CEC), have raised questions in recent years. In August, a California state court ruled in a lawsuit that its operations are \u201ctextbook extortion.\u201d The case also suggests that CEC\u2019s operations have little to do with the concept and intentions of restorative justice, an expert says.\n\nHow the program works\n\nCEC and Walmart, which is not named in the lawsuit, have not responded to repeated Quartz requests for interviews. As recounted in court documents, media reports, and online accounts from self-professed shoplifters\u2014here\u2019s what the process typically looks like:\n\nA shoplifter is caught or accused of stealing from a store. If they are a first-time offender, not part of an organized-crime group, and not intoxicated, security officers will show them a video explaining that they can pay several hundred dollars (up to $500) to participate in a 6-8 hour online course.\n\nCEC\u2019s founder, in an promotional video on the company\u2019s website, says the program is meant to help people understand their behavior and its consequences, and includes an element that teaches \u201clife skills,\u201d such as how to build a resume or a nutrition plan. They can take the course at a later time, and the company says they have 48 hours to make up their minds.\n\nThe alternative is a phone call to local police\u2014according to the company, about 90% of the accused shoplifters who watched the video in California chose the CEC route. The lawsuit alleges the company gets the bulk of the fee, and it also pays a chunk to the retailer and security contractors.\n\n\u00a0CEC calls the program a win for all. \u00a0CEC, founded by two Harvard Business School graduates in 2010, calls the program a win for all. The store does not have to constantly interact with law-enforcement agencies. Police do not have to respond to hundreds of petty-theft cases. The accused offender avoids getting sucked into the criminal-justice system, and the community doesn\u2019t have to pay the costs associated with the process. CEC, which has worked with other retailers such as Bloomingdale\u2019s and Whole Foods Market across the country, says their recidivism rate is less than 2 percent\u2014although the methodology they use to come up with this statistic is unclear. CEC also claims calls made to police have fallen as much as 40% in some locations.\n\nThe problem with private solutions\n\nThe suit in California, filed in 2015 by the San Francisco city attorney, Dennis Herrera, called the CEC process \u201cextortion.\u201d Detaining an accused shoplifter in order to show them the video should be considered false imprisonment, the suit alleged, something that big retailers have been accused of for years. A judge agreed in an Aug. 14 ruling, calling it a \u201ctextbook extortion,\u201d and holding that the program indeed constituted illegal false imprisonment under California law\u2014noting however, that he did not need to decide whether CEC\u2019s program is beneficial or not to the public.\n\nThe ruling means that CEC will be prohibited from continuing its current practices; the judge has asked Herrera\u2019s team and CEC to reach an agreement as to the exact scope of the prohibitions, which will eventually be entered as a court order. (CEC will have an opportunity to appeal the ruling.)\n\nThe Utah-based company said in a statement it was \u201cshocked and dismayed\u201d by the decision: \u201cWe believe this ruling goes against the values of Californians. We are disheartened for our partners and even more importantly for those Californians who face a lifelong scarlet letter because of one bad choice.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, reducing the number of people who get arrested, jailed, and left with a conviction on their record\u2014which often prevents them from getting jobs\u2014is an important goal in a country that locks up more people than nearly any other place on Earth. And it should come as no surprise that most of the accused prefer to avoid interacting with law enforcement. They pony up the fee and log on to complete the course. (The company says it offers reduced fees but told Slate in 2015 that 85% of the offenders pay the full price, and only 2% have qualified for a full discount).\n\nHowever, involving the police in shoplifting cases does not mean automatically locking up and convicting suspects. David Karp, a professor of sociology at Skidmore College and expert on restorative justice, tells Quartz that first-time offenders might not end up with a serious charge, or any sort of jail time. Getting sucked into the criminal-justice system usually isn\u2019t helpful to a defendant, Karp says, but it does offer legal protections that are not guaranteed when dealing with private companies.\n\nSlate interviewed several defense attorneys about the program, and they all expressed serious concerns about a private company acting as a judge, especially considering that retailers make mistakes when identifying shoplifters.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, police, prosecutors, and courts have access to their own diversion programs for misdemeanor offenses (although these come with a hefty price tag as well). CEC could partner with police in programs in which officers could refer eligible shoplifters, Karp says: \u201cThat puts the power of the decision-making more in the hands of the defendant.\u201d\n\nThe California suit also alleged the program creates incentives for retailers and security operators to push the CEC option, instead of ensuring alleged offenders get due process through the legal system.\n\nWhat is restorative justice?\n\nCEC says it operates according to the tenets of restorative justice, a concept outlined by American criminologist Howard Zehr in his seminal 1990 book Changing Lenses, A New Focus for Crime and Justice. The philosophy draws from the justice systems of indigenous groups in the United States and Canada, as well as New Zealand. It does not focus on \u201cpunishing a person by inflicting some kind of harm on them that\u2019s similar to the harm that they caused others,\u201d says Karp. Instead, it\u2019s \u201cabout having the offender somehow address the harm that they caused,\u201d whether it\u2019s emotional, material, or it affects the broader community.\n\nKarp says that generally, the idea that the CEC program is meant to be educational rather than punitive falls in line with the philosophy\u2019s precepts. But, although he hasn\u2019t seen the program\u2019s content, he is skeptical of its claim to be a restorative-justice solution.\n\n\u00a0\u201cThe true impact from restorative justice comes from a face-to-face discussion of the impact of a person\u2019s behavior on others.\u201d \u00a0One big issue is the program\u2019s online aspect (it\u2019s also reportedly available on paper). \u201cThe true impact from restorative justice comes from a face-to-face discussion of the impact of a person\u2019s behavior on others,\u201d Karp says. \u201cWhat we generally know about prevention-based programming is that online educational workshops are not effective in changing behavior.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of the money paid by the alleged offender. Restitution, as traditionally understood, is payment for losses. \u201cThe person caught shoplifting never got the item out of the store, so there is no direct loss that the person is responsible for reimbursing,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThere is a cost associated with loss prevention, but that cost is not specified and it is unclear what the obligation of one shoplifter is toward that overall cost,\u201d he adds. With all of this uncertainty, he says, \u201d it is easy to see how other motives can appear,\u201d such as financial gain for the retailers, and for CEC (The security company also receives a cut). Karp calls the CEC solution more of a fine combined with an \u201cuntested\u201d rehabilitation program, rather than true restorative justice.\n\nA big retail store is not the best setting for restorative justice\n\nUsing restorative justice in a situation where the victim is a massive corporation is not ideal. \u201cIt works best when the harm is clear. When I steal your phone, punch you in the face, and that discussion is really impactful. When the harm is really unclear, like this two-dollar item at this two-billion-dollar company, it doesn\u2019t really work quite as well,\u201d Karp says. The mentality of shoplifting being a \u201cvictimless crime\u201d is clear when you read Reddit posts from shoplifters who talk about the Walmart-owning Walton family as \u201csilver-spooned assholes.\u201d\n\nThere is a way for even large retailers to address shoplifting in ways that fall in line with restorative-justice principles, Karp says.\n\nThe Longmont Community Justice Partnership in Colorado, founded in 1992, works with large retailers, taking a much more involved approach. It primarily works with the local Kohl\u2019s store, as well as Target and Home Depot, and had gotten referrals from Walmart before they introduced their own program.\n\nAn outside recidivism study of the Colorado program for 2007-2008 showed that fewer than 10% of those who completed the course were rearrested within a year. Offenders also have to pay for the program on a sliding scale, with a maximum $125 fee.\n\nIn the Longmont process, the retailer\u2019s representative decides whether to offer the restorative-justice option. A police officer will give an offender the official referral, says Abby Whipple, Longmont program manager. This keeps law enforcement involved and, at least in theory, ensures a degree of due process.\n\nBecause the organization was getting so many referrals from the local Kohl\u2019s, it recently introduced a group program in which offenders, community members, and store representatives speak in a series of meetings, along with facilitators. The offenders hear about the harm they had caused, and share their own stories.\n\n\u201cAcross the board I can hear them saying \u2019I just don\u2019t see how [the shoplifting] would make a difference to anyone,\u2019\u201d Whipple says. Most are between the ages of 13 and 17.\n\nIn an intimate, personal setting, a huge company like Kohl\u2019s offers a human face\u2014the store\u2019s loss-prevention representative. Whipple says he outlines all the ways the community is affected by shoplifting. Prices may rise since retailers have to recoup their losses; employee hours may be cut, and positions eliminated; lines at stores can get longer; there can be losses in tax revenue for the town, money which could have been used for parks and filling potholes. \u201cOn top of that,\u201d Whipple says in recounting the rep\u2019s approach, \u201cyou have employees in the store, who care about it and appreciate their jobs, and they feel both on edge and victimized by people attempting to shoplift from the store.\u201d\n\nShe says the offenders primarily relate to the lost job opportunities, as well as longer lines and higher prices.\n\nAt the end of the process, the parties come up with a contract, according to what Whipple calls a \u201cstrength-based\u201d approach. The loss-prevention representative asks the offenders write letters of reflection, and has a massive stack of them in his office. One person made a piece of graffiti art that spells out \u201cDon\u2019t Steal.\u201d Another baked cheesecakes that were shared with all of the store\u2019s employees. A police officer told a career-oriented 17-year-old girl to develop a business plan, which he saw as valuable to the community, as part of her contract.\n\n\u201cWe want everyone to see the humanness in the other people that have been involved in what happened\u2014including the police, the loss-prevention rep. Making an \u2018us\u2019 out of everyone who has to respond to this incident.\u201d\n\nA reflection of a broader debate\n\nThe contrast between the approaches of Corrective Education Company and the Longmont Community Justice Partnership is indicative of a larger rift in efforts to reform the US criminal-justice system.\n\nOn one side, you have methods that focus on old-school, face-to-face interaction, the \u201chuman\u201d element. On the other, you have technology companies that offer to make the system more attuned to today\u2019s world\u2014making communication easier and processes more efficient, programs such as CEC\u2019s, video-chatting services in prisons and jails, or providers of sentencing algorithm software.\n\nBut when profit enters the equation, things often turn against alleged offenders, especially those with fewer resources to defend themselves.",
