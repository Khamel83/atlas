      "Title": "The stupid reason that larger clothes fit so badly Quartz",
      "Selection": "A common complaint among women who wear sizes 16 and up is that if they can find items in their size at all, it\u2019s even harder to find clothes that fit well. More than just an annoyance, the problem can be dispiriting and humiliating, and leave women feeling excluded from fashion. What\u2019s especially absurd about this situation is that the average American woman is now a size 16 to 18, according to the most recent research\u2014suggesting that most women in America are struggling to find clothes that fit right.\n\nOf course it\u2019s just the natural fact that not all bodies share the same shape, even at the same size. But part of the blame for the problem, according to industry insiders, lies with the fashion brands themselves.\n\nThe issue is the way many clothing companies create their range of sizes\u2014by using a single fit model and mathematically scaling up and down based on that one person\u2019s measurements. At larger sizes in particular, the result could be tops that are too small in the bust or overly boxy; bottoms that fit in the rear but not at the waist; seams and pockets hitting at all the wrong places.\n\nThere is a solution: All brands need to do is fit their clothes on larger models. The trouble is that doing this for every garment costs time and money, and many brands aren\u2019t willing to invest that\u2014either because they don\u2019t care to or they don\u2019t realize they need to.\n\nThat can create a self-reinforcing cycle, where brands aren\u2019t able to sell their ill-fitting, larger-sized garments, so they conclude that they don\u2019t have many larger-size customers. In turn, they don\u2019t design their new products with those customers in mind\u2014ensuring they won\u2019t win them over. The upshot? Brands are probably missing out on sales they could make if they just fit their clothes better, and customers who wear larger sizes are left with few options that work for them.\n\nHow fit problems start\n\nThe fit models brands use to calibrate their sizing aren\u2019t like the runway or editorial models most people associate with fashion, but they\u2019re equally important, if not more so. Unlike runway models, who are preternaturally tall and thin, fit models represent something like the platonic ideal of a brand\u2019s real-life customers. Their bodies are the perfect proportions for, say, the standard women\u2019s size 6\u2014one of the most popular sizes brands hire. And unlike mannequins (paywall), they allow you to see how clothes move, and can offer feedback if something doesn\u2019t feel right.\n\nHere\u2019s how it generally works: A women\u2019s clothing brand will find the fit model it likes and create its size 6 based on her measurements. Then, in a process called grading, it will use software to mathematically scale the dimensions up or down for its other sizes. For each increase in tagged size, a brand might add one inch to the bust of a shirt, room in the shoulders, and length in the sleeves. Each company has its own rules for how its clothes change from size to size.\n\n\u00a0A single fit model could be the basis for one label\u2019s entire range of sizes\u00a0\n\nA single fit model could be the basis for the entire range of sizes at one label\u2014or at several. Some fit models become industry favorites and the template for the fit of numerous lines.\n\nThe method works well enough for sizes close to the fit model\u2019s, but potentially less so as the sizes move away. \u201cWhen you\u2019re four or five sizes away from a fit model size, you\u2019re talking about something that\u2019s kind of been stretched and distorted, and you\u2019re hoping it fits somebody,\u201d explains Abe Burmeister, founder of clothing brand Outlier, which sells only men\u2019s clothing now but for years had a women\u2019s line as well. \u201cThey work to a pretty decent extent. But at the same time it\u2019s nothing like when something is tailored to you, or somebody very similar to you.\u201d\n\nHuman bodies generally don\u2019t scale up uniformly with each increase in size. There can be much more of a difference between a size 8 and a size 12 than there is between a size 8 and a size 4.\n\nThis issue is at the heart of the poorly fitting clothes many brands offer their customers in bigger sizes, according to Mark-Evan Blackman, a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York who teaches fitting and formerly had his own large-sized brand. \u201cWhen certain size ranges are chronically not fitting well,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s because they\u2019re not being fit and are being mathematically graded up.\u201d If you evenly grade the bust on a size 6 up to a size 12, for instance, it\u2019s likely to turn out too small.\n\nBrands need to design for all sizes, starting with their fit models. (Joel Ryan/Invision/AP)\nHow brands can create clothes that fit\n\nThe problem is fixable, though, and the solution isn\u2019t complicated.\n\n\u201cFit regularly on a professional fit model who is a size 18 or the size most sold by the brand, and conduct wear tests and/or size sets,\u201d says Dale Noelle, the founder and president of True Model Management, a modeling agency that works with a large number of fit models.\n\nWear tests refer to when brands give models or employees sample items to wear and wash over time before producing them for the market. Size sets are when a brand fits a garment on fit models in multiple sizes (the ideal practice). Noelle, who was a fit model herself for many years, says they allow a company to confirm that the grading rules they\u2019ve applied fit all their sizes well\u2014so that pockets are hitting in the right place, for instance, and the dimensions look right on most customers.\n\nThere\u2019s a bit potential benefit for brands taking these steps: Customers who wear larger sizes tend to be loyal shoppers once they find a brand that fits them\u2014as the success of the millennial-favorite ModCloth has found, marketing its quirky, hip, vintage-inspired style to a wide range of sizes. The Walmart-owned e-commerce company Jet recently purchased the company.\n\nMarshall Cohen, chief retail analyst for research firm NPD Group, estimates that sales of what are generally called plus-size clothes, most often meaning size 16 and up, are about half what they could be if the fashion industry made more options available.\n\nAnd why they don\u2019t\n\nBrands don\u2019t generally share their fitting practices outside the company, but Blackman calls it \u201cindustry knowledge\u201d that most do not use multiple fit models for sizing.\n\nNoelle\u2019s experience backs his statement. She says most companies use one fit model for each of their lines. The typical model used for missy sizing\u2014the industry name for the common run of sizes\u2014is a 6. Brands with plus lines often will hire a size 18 model for fittings and grade its other sizes based on her measurements. But many brands still don\u2019t have dedicated lines for their larger customers, and if they offer sizes above 16, they may still be basing the measurements on that size 6 model.\n\nOne reason many brands don\u2019t hire fit models in different sizes is the cost. Depending on the city and model, they can command rates (paywall) of more than $100 an hour, or upwards of twice that. Multiply the figure by several models trying on a range of garments\u2014since the cut of a garment can also affect how it should be sized up\u2014and the cost can add up, especially for small brands.\n\nBut Burmeister believes there may be another underlying factor at play. \u201cOur stuff forms a pretty clean bell curve around the fit model size, and that\u2019s how we plan and how we order and everything,\u201d he says. \u201cI realized it\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0Brands interpret those low sales as meaning they don\u2019t have an audience of larger-size customers\u00a0\n\nWhat he means is that the sizes closest to the fit model sell the best, since they usually offer customers the best fit and look good in the dressing room. The further away from the fit model\u2019s size that you get, the worse the fit becomes and less likely customers are to buy the garment. Brands interpret those low sales as meaning they don\u2019t have an audience of larger-size customers, which convinces them it\u2019s not worth investing the resources in appealing to that audience\u2014such as by also hiring a larger-sized fit model. That\u2019s why the fit problems in larger sizes continue.\n\nIt\u2019s similar to the way brick-and-mortar stores may come to believe customers who wear larger sizes don\u2019t shop there, when what\u2019s keeping the customers at bay is actually a poor shopping experience for them.\n\nSolutions require investment\n\nBurmeister admits his brand suffered from this issue when it had a women\u2019s line, and understands what a challenge it is to overcome. \u201cEvery time I read articles and people are pointing out that plus-size women are under-represented, especially given how large the market is, well you know the sales data probably at all these brands is telling them that they have no sales there,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if you wanted to combat that, if your sales data is telling you \u2018don\u2019t bother,\u2019 it takes a real commitment in order to get there.\u201d\n\nTo complicate matters further, many brands consider just one body shape, when Blackman says women generally fall into one of four different shapes, which can be more pronounced in larger sizes: A woman\u2019s figure might run straight from top to bottom; she might have an hourglass figure; and then there are women who are larger on top than on the bottom, and vice versa.\n\nThese challenges aren\u2019t insurmountable, however. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to go after four [shapes], but it\u2019s fine to go after two,\u201d says Blackman. \u201cIf you go after two and do it well, you\u2019re hitting 50% of the market.\u201d\n\nTo solve such problems will require real investment from fashion brands in both time and money as they make larger sizes a priority and not just an afterthought. But if they\u2019re serious about serving the many American customers dissatisfied with the fit of their products, it\u2019s an investment that can pay off.\n\n\u201cShe will buy,\u201d Blackman says, \u201cif it fits her.\u201d\n\nMost Popular\n",
