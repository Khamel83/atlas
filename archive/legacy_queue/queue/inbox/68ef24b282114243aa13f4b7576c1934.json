      "Title": "America\u2019s new recycling crisis, explained by an expert Vox - All",
      "Selection": "For 30 years, China took in the world\u2019s plastic. What happened when they stopped?\n \nFor all the campaigns encouraging people to recycle more, few lay out exactly what happens to our recyclables once they go into the blue bin. Rather than our milk jugs magically reincarnating into toys on their own, for nearly three decades American recyclables were shipped cheaply to China, where they could be sold and given new shape. \n\nThat worked well enough, until China started cracking down. With dirty waste continuing to appear in imported recyclables, the rising cost of labor, and an abundance of the country\u2019s own potentially recyclable waste, China no longer had the same financial and environmental incentives to accept the world\u2019s waste. \n\nWithin the recycling community, there had been rumblings that China might change its policies, but the force of Operation National Sword, announced in July 2017, still came as a surprise. Going into full effect last March, it banned 24 types of scrap and implemented much stricter and more rigorous contamination standards which have been described as \u201cimpossible to reach.\u201d As a result, local governments and the recycling industry are now facing an unprecedented recycling crisis, especially in plastics.\n\nK. Y. Cheng/South China Morning Post via Getty Images\nPlastic recycling must now meet \u201cimpossible\u201d contamination standards. \n\nTo put the impact of this current crisis into the context of past waste crises \u2014 like the Love Canal Disaster, where a residential neighborhood was built on a toxic waste dump with disastrous consequences, leading to the formation of the EPA\u2019s Superfund program \u2014 and to understand how the effects of this policy are being felt across the United States, The Goods spoke to Kate O\u2019Neill, an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management at UC Berkeley. Specializing in global environmental politics and the global politics of waste, her upcoming book Waste explores the extent to which waste can be a resource, and she has written and spoken extensively about the recycling trade with China. \n\nWhat\u2019s the history of the US sending recyclables to China?\n\nChina imported most of the world\u2019s scrap, the good stuff as well as the more problematic, especially as its industry started to boom in the late \u201990s and early 2000s. It was also connected with China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001. That was a period where China\u2019s growth started booming. It was shipping goods to Europe and the States and that enabled a cheap process of shipping the scrap back to China in the holds of the ships that had brought all the stuff over. So that made it cheaper to ship to China than, say, to ship recycling across the country. And China was the market \u2014 that\u2019s where it went to be used. We were shipping it to China because there was demand from its manufacturing sector because it wasn\u2019t producing enough virgin plastic. So there was an economic rationale.\n\nIs it that China doesn\u2019t need our recyclables now that they have enough of their own?\n\nIt produces plastics for its domestic market and has a lot of plastic scrap of its own to recycle. This is very similar to the dynamics with electronic waste, because China imported a lot of that for a while, and illegally for quite a while too, and then started really cleaning up its recycling villages and creating more industrial parks for domestic recycling. It\u2019s trying to do the same with plastics. \n\nI also think Beijing is very concerned about their environmental quality and image overseas. As China is taking on this role as the world\u2019s economic superpower, there are aspects that are not just pure economics or military power, but a sort of leadership by example. We see it with efforts in China to combat climate change. I also think that they were very concerned about being seen as the world\u2019s dump site.\n\nHow do past rumblings and claims of crisis compare to now? Is the shit hitting the fan?\n\n\u201cOh, the shit\u2019s hitting the fan\u201d\n\nOh, the shit\u2019s hitting the fan. Operation Green Fence was the 2013 effort to just start getting exporting countries to clean their recycling, their plastics in particular. That sent ripples, but that was more enforcing existing legislation, it wasn\u2019t a severe cut in contamination limits. The recycling industry saw it as more of a, \u201cWell, let\u2019s kind of clean up our act at the collection stage and not bother the consumers with this.\u201d What happened was that suddenly a whole cleaning services industry sprang up in Southeast Asia, so you knew you could ship it to Malaysia where it would be cleaned if it didn\u2019t meet China\u2019s specifications. \n\nAbsolutely no one thinks they\u2019re going to lift this restriction at any point, and it\u2019s really been exacerbated by the trade war with the US. [China has] had periodic disruptions, just temporary ones, on the import of other kinds of scrap like iron, copper, and aluminum. But there\u2019s demand in their own recycling industries for that so it\u2019d be tricky for Beijing to say no to importing that kind of scrap. But plastics now, no one sees any lifting on those restrictions anytime soon. \n\nIt seems like this is a type of crisis we\u2019ve never had to face before, but based on impact does it compare to anything else?\n\nOnly nuclear waste. Obviously it\u2019s not the same as a widespread nuclear waste accident, but I think it\u2019s the most widespread, and I would definitely call this the most high-profile and prolonged period I\u2019ve seen waste in the global press in many, many years. \n\nThinking back over early waste crises, again, it\u2019s not quite the same danger to human health, but it\u2019s on par with Love Canal and those big events in the \u201960s and \u201970s. We\u2019ve really been displacing those risks \u2014 out of sight, out of mind \u2014 either to poor minority communities in the case of hazardous waste, or now to displacing our plastic and paper waste to communities where \u2014 although it\u2019s used in China \u2014 it was being disassembled and reprocessed by people who are very much being exposed to the worst risks. \n\nHow is this going to start impacting our lives here in the US?\n\nIt already has in so many ways. There\u2019s the ripple effect for our lives and also globally. Initially the plan was just to divert the plastics to different places like Southeast Asia. That has not been working because countries like Malaysia and Thailand have become overwhelmed with plastic and stopped importing. India just announced it would not take plastics, so the quest for markets is still ongoing.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of campaigns for consumer education, getting rid of what the industry calls \u201cwish cycling\u201d [the well-intentioned attempt to recycle nonrecyclables, which causes contamination and more waste] and encouraging people to properly wash recyclables. You\u2019ve got a shift away from single-stream recycling, when you put everything into the one big container, to multiple stream, where you\u2019re separating recyclables into different containers. \n\n\u201cThere was no matching or building of recycling capacity along with the increase in recycling programs\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re seeing an increase in landfilling, and because most states have fees for landfills, that\u2019s creating an additional expense [for municipalities]. Plastics went from [selling for] like $300 a ton at their peak to now where you almost have to pay to get rid of them. Municipalities are cutting back on their recycling and what they will pick up, some places have stopped recycling altogether. This includes not just plastic but also glass, not because it was ever exported to China but because it\u2019s difficult and expensive to recycle in the first place, so when you\u2019re losing money because of plastics you\u2019re not going to keep propping up a real economic loss generator like glass.\n\nAfter years of hearing that we should recycle more, it\u2019s pretty shocking to realize that we don\u2019t have an infrastructure that can deal with all of it. \n\nRecycling started in the \u201970s and \u201980s but it took a while to really spread and certainly to become kind of mandatory. [Over the past 20 years] there was no matching or building of recycling capacity along with the increase in recycling programs. I was living in New York in the mid \u201990s and I remember when the recycling came in, that maps directly onto the years when we started exporting to China. \n\nThere\u2019s an interesting debate warming up about if we should focus on improving our recycling or if that is going to enable our continued consumption of plastics. In other words, let\u2019s not focus on recycling, let\u2019s just focus on not using plastics. I personally think that we need to do both, and I\u2019m concerned about this argument that we shouldn\u2019t even be improving recycling, that we just need to focus on not using plastic, because that seems like a lot harder of a goal to reach. \n\nWant more stories from The Goods by Vox?
