      "Title": "All the times Republicans expressed moral outrage at Donald Trump\u2019s threats to bar Muslims from the US Quartz",
      "Selection": "The reaction from US president Donald Trump\u2019s own Republican party when he first called for a ban on all Muslim travel to the United States, in December of 2015, was swift and harsh.\n\nRepublican leaders vehemently condemned the suggestion from the billionaire upstart who was then leading in the GOP primary race. \u201cOffensive and unconstitutional,\u201d were the words of Mike Pence\u2014before he joined Trump\u2019s ticket as his vice president. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said it was \u201cnot conservatism.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell called it \u201ccompletely inconsistent\u201d with American values. Even former vice president Dick Cheney said it \u201cgoes against everything we stand for and believe in.\u201d\n\nYesterday, Trump made a first step toward fulfilling his campaign promise when he signed an executive order temporarily banning visitors from the Muslim-majority countries Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen, and barred refugees from Syria indefinitely.\n\nLegal scholars have called the order unconstitutional because it appears to specifically target Muslims, and because Trump has said the system would prioritize Christians from the countries named. Civil rights groups have filed initial legal challenges to the order. And protests are gathering at John F. Kennedy International Airport, where two Iraqi refugees were detained, including one who had served as an interpreter for the US.\n\nStill, since Trump signed yesterday\u2019s executive order, no major Republican leader has yet spoken out against Trump\u2019s order.\n\nBelow are some of the statements from Republican leaders made prior to yesterday\u2019s executive action:\n\nCalls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional.\n\n\u2014 Governor Mike Pence (@GovPenceIN) December 8, 2015\n\n\u201cFreedom of religion is a fundamental constitutional principle. It\u2019s a founding principle of this country\u2026 This is not conservatism. What was proposed yesterday is not what this party stands for. And more importantly, it\u2019s not what this country stands for.\u201d \u2013 Speaker of the House Paul Ryan\n\n\u201c[A Muslim ban is] completely and totally inconsistent with American values\u201d \u2013 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\n\n\u201cWell, I think this whole notion that somehow we can just say no more Muslims, just ban a whole religion, goes against everything we stand for and believe in. I mean, religious freedom has been a very important part of our history and where we came from.\u201d \u2013 Former US vice president Dick Cheney\n\n\u201cYou do not need to be banning Muslims from the country. That\u2019s, in my view, that\u2019s a ridiculous position and one that won\u2019t even be productive.\u201d \u2013 New Jersey governor Chris Christie\n\n\u201cWe need to aggressively take on radical Islamic terrorism but not at the expense of our American values.\u201d \u2013 White House chief of staff Reince Priebus\n\nI disagree with Donald Trump's latest proposal. His habit of making offensive and outlandish statements will not bring Americans together.\n\n\u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) December 8, 2015\n",
