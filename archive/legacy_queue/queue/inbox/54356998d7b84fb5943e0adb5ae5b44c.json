      "Selection": "Posie Harwood, who\u00a0finds the best back-of-the-box recipes in the grocery store, is taking one-bowl brownies to new (excessively frosted) heights.\n\nI've sampled a lot of brownies in my life. Personally, if I were to get philosophical about it, I like a brownie that teeters on the edge of fudge-like. It should just toe the line: A slight cakiness should keep it from being too dense. Rich but not too rich, it should freeze beautifully and make you the star of all potlucks and picnics and birthday parties, forever and always.\u00a0\n\nThis one-bowl recipe fits the bill exactly. It comes from the back of the Baker's Chocolate\u00a0box, and it could not be easier. You melt butter and chocolate together, then whisk in the rest of your ingredients. That's it! You don't have to temper chocolate, or clean multiple bowls, or worry about technique.\n\nThe original recipe calls for nuts. I didn't add them because, to be perfectly\u00a0honest with you, I didn't have any in my kitchen. If you're into that sort of thing, you can toss a cup of chopped nuts into the batter.\n\nMore:\u00a0Are you a cakey or a fudgy person?\n\nIf you want to get really wild, you could add chocolate chips. Should you? Probably not. We are going to add some frosting soon, and chocolate chips might push us into\u00a0the territory of true excess. But if you think you can handle it, I trust you. Go forth and douse yourself with chocolate.\n\nThe frosting is delicious.\u00a0First, you\u00a0melt butter, buttermilk, and cocoa powder in a saucepan. The buttermilk gives a subtle\u00a0tang that helps to balance the intense sweetness of the frosting. Then, you transfer the\u00a0warm mixture to a stand mixer (or large bowl with a hand mixer) and beat it\u00a0with powdered sugar.\n\nIf the frosting gives you any trouble, here's some advice I gleaned from own mistakes: If your\u00a0frosting is\u00a0very thin and liquidy,\u00a0try sticking the bowl in the refrigerator for 20 minutes to chill it. Colder frosting will whip into a lighter, fluffier texture. If it still looks too thin, add more confectioners' sugar. I suggest starting with 2 cups, but you might need up to 4 cups.\n\nChocolate Buttermilk-Frosted Brownies\n\nAdapted from\u00a0Baker's Chocolate\n\nMakes one\u00a09- by 13-inch pan\n\nFor the brownies:\n\n4\u00a0ounces unsweetened chocolate3/4\u00a0cup butter2\u00a0cups sugar3\u00a0eggs1\u00a0teaspoon vanilla extract1\u00a0cup flour\n\nFor the frosting:\n\n1/4\u00a0cup butter3\u00a0tablespoons buttermilk3\u00a0tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder1/2\u00a0teaspoon vanilla extract2 to 4\u00a0cups confectioners' sugar\n\nSee the full recipe (and save and print it) here.\n\nDo you have a favorite back of the box recipe, or have you heard about a great one?
