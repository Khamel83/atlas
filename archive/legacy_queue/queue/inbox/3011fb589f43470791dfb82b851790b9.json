      "Selection": "American Express has slowly been refreshing its card portfolio, introducing new benefits and increasing earning with cards like the\u00a0American Express\u00ae Gold Card\u00a0and the American Express\u00ae Business Gold Card. Most recently, the card issuer\u00a0announced changes to the Business Platinum\u00ae Card from American Express, adding up to $200 in statement credits toward Dell purchases each year, and a yearlong membership to WeWork. These additional perks come with a higher annual fee: $595, up from $450.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never heard of WeWork, it\u2019s a rapidly growing real estate company that provides flexible office space with amenities, hip decor and events to entrepreneurs and startup companies around the world.\n\nUntil today, we did not know exactly what type of membership card holders would receive other than that WeWork and Amex claimed it was a benefit worth $2,700.\n\nThe lobby of WeWork branch in Shanghai, China.

Platinum Global Access is only available to Business Platinum card holders, meaning those without the card will not be able to purchase this type of membership.\n\nWhat exactly do you get with Platinum Global Access? WeWork describes it as such:\n\nPlatinum Global Access includes access to WeWork\u2019s 300+ locations around the world, during local business hours. This includes access to open workspace and premium amenities, including Wi-Fi, phone booths, and refreshments, like coffee, tea, and fruit water. Platinum Global Access members also get a dedicated member support team and invites to exclusive Platinum Global Access-only events.\n\nWhen I started working at TPG in 2016, we were actually based in a WeWork in downtown Manhattan (oh, how things have changed). WeWorks generally have a common area with tables, couches and a kitchen \u2014 adjoining these areas are private offices that are rented out by individuals and companies. With Platinum Global Access, you\u2019ll only have access to these common workspaces, not a private office.\n\nThis seems similar to WeWork\u2019s basic \u201cHot Desk\u201d option that starts at $220 a month \u2014 that\u2019s likely where the $2,700 valuation comes in ($220 x 12 = $2,640). Although unlike other memberships, Platinum Global Access grants entry to all locations without any additional fee.\n\nWeWork says that Platinum Global Access will only allow access to WeWork buildings during normal business hours, from 9 am to 6 pm, Monday through Friday. While common spaces typically close at 6pm, Amex notes that office hours do vary by location so you may be able to spend more time there, especially if you\u2019ve already entered the building. You\u2019ll have access to conference rooms and printing, but you\u2019ll have to purchase credits if you want to use either.\n\nFinally, you can book a hot desk in advance, which can be done in as little as an hour ahead of time. Members can still swipe into a WeWork without advanced notice but there may be times when a location is at capacity, so booking ahead can help guarantee a space to work, an Amex representative told TPG.\n\nWhen to Sign Up\n\nYou can sign up for the benefit here, and although the official launch date isn\u2019t until Feb. 15, Amex confirmed with us that you can start using the offer immediately. Once enrolled, you\u2019ll receive a welcome email from WeWork (two to three business days after signing up) which will notify you that you can start booking space at one of WeWork\u2019s 425 locations around the globe.\n\nOnly primary card holders are eligible for the benefit, so any authorized users won\u2019t be able to get a membership of their own.\n\nAnother important thing to consider is when to enroll. You\u2019ll have to sign up by Dec. 31, 2019 \u2014 after that the benefit will no longer be available \u2014 but your yearlong membership will begin on whatever date you enroll. It may make sense to wait to sign up until you know when you\u2019re actually going to start using WeWork.\n\nFor more on the Business Platinum Card from American Express, see:\n\nCredit Card Review: The Business Platinum Card From American Express\n\nAmex Business Platinum Now Offers WeWork Access and Has a Higher Fee\n\nFeatured image courtesy of WeWork.\n",
