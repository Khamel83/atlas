      "Title": "Quartz\u2019s most powerful personal essays from 2016 Quartz",
      "Selection": "2016 was a year few of us will ever forget. But while many will remember it as a year of challenge and heartbreak, there were moments of celebration and introspection as well. This range of human emotion was reflected in Quartz\u2019s Ideas essays over the past 12 months well, many of which expressed frustration and sadness\u2014as well as hope, self-examination, and even joy.\n\nThe Ideas section of Quartz has published many, many personal accounts over the past 12 months so a top 10 list was essentially impossible. Here, in no particular order, are some of the pieces that resonated the most with us this past year.\n\nCraigslist confessional: \u201cOne look at me, and people think I\u2019m privileged\u201d\n\nBy Helena Bala\n\n\u201cI let people see what they want\u2014the picture of me that\u2019s easiest to digest. It\u2019s neater than the truth. There\u2019s so much criticism directed at millennials nowadays that any whisper of a complaint draws out mass accusations of entitlement\u2014even where it doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s all about the bootstraps stories and the easy narratives of people who struggled but then they just pulled themselves together and made it.\u201d\n\nI won $68,000 on daytime TV and learned three things about controlling high-stress situations\n\nBy Molly Rubin\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a cheat sheet. I couldn\u2019t really change the odds. But just knowing the odds gave me the confidence I needed to perform well under pressure. Because I had the tools to make an informed decision, the game didn\u2019t feel so random anymore.\u201d\n\nDear America: What does justice look like for black people in a land that never loved us?\n\nBy Reniqua Allen\n\n\u201cAmerica, you bastard. You are an idea, a system that we now see was always built on deception, theft, destruction, violence, slavery, and rape. You tout supremacy and exceptionalism, but your embrace of privilege, patriarchy, and whiteness proves otherwise. It proves you\u2019re no better than the rest.\u201d\n\nDelivering balloons to funeral homes made me care about humanity more than my millennial side hustle\n\nBy Michael Rogan\n\n\u201cI\u2019d answered the Craigslist ad thinking I\u2019d be working in a Norman Rockwell painting, handing bright fun to smiling kids all day. I would have been more apprehensive had I known I\u2019d be working 10-hour days transporting these fragile balls of panic all over Manhattan.\u201d\n\nI went to Guantanamo Bay to watch the Khalid Sheikh Mohammad hearing, and what I saw shocked me\n\nBy Maggie Cleary \n\n\u201cGuantanamo Bay is a panoply of contradictions. It is military base representing freedom and justice that is situated on a less-than-welcoming communist island. Now it is an island lost in time, perched in the recesses of the American imagination. In one afternoon you can drive by Camp X-Ray, where the detainees were first brought after they were captured, and then swing by a gift store and pick up t-shirts, shot glasses, and a stuffed iguana.\u201d\n\nTrying to scare women away from traveling alone won\u2019t keep them safe\n\nBy Jessa Crispin\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a large part of our culture that believes women should stay at home where they will be \u2018safe.\u2019 The road, the world\u2013those are the danger zones. We hear this so often that we start to believe it, and we behave accordingly. When I head off on another solo trip, it\u2019s often my married friends who clutch my wrist and tell me with a slightly anxious edge, \u2018Stay safe!\u2019 I often want to say to them, \u2018Yeah. You too.'\u201d\n\nMy boyfriend insisted a gun would keep us \u201csafer\u201d up until the day he shot me in the face\n\nBy Courtney Weaver\n\n\u201cGetting shot was the most embarrassing thing that ever happened to me. An intimate relationship is private. Suddenly, mine was open to public scrutiny. I felt shame because secretly I still struggled with my romantic feelings\u2014they didn\u2019t just vanish after he left me for dead. I still wrestle with that.\u201d\n\nA lot of women don\u2019t enjoy hookup culture\u2014so why do we force ourselves to participate?\n\nBy Leah Fessler\n\n\u201cFor many women, there\u2019s nothing liberating about emotionless, non-committal sex. The young women I spoke with were taking part in hookup culture because they thought that was what guys wanted, or because they hoped a casual encounter would be a stepping stone to commitment. In doing this, we actually deny ourselves agency and bolster male dominance, all while convincing ourselves we\u2019re acting like progressive feminists.\u201d\n\nGetting my book rejected 24 times made me realize what American culture gets wrong about failure\n\nBy Bene Cipolla\n\n\u201cWhat feels most honest, to me, is to consider the possibility that failure is a richer and more intriguing experience than I\u2019ve given it credit for. Perhaps it\u2019s not a stage that I ought to move through as quickly as possible, but a place to hang out for a little while.\u201d\n\nQuitting Twitter helped me learn to be an adult again\n\nBy Haroon Moghul\n\n\u201cTwitter was beginning to make me feel terrible, and yet I kept going back, needing more and more of it to reach the same high. I could sense the damaging compulsion for months; friends, loved ones, and random strangers engaged in various degrees of intervention. But like any addict, I rationalized. Because I needed it.\u201d\n\nI tracked my happiness for a year to get data on how to build a more joyful life\n\nBy Katherine Ellen Foley\n\n\u201cThrough the ups and downs of 2016, I made a point of recording every time I felt overwhelmingly happy, confident, and at peace, and what made me feel that way\u2014just a sentence fragment or two and the date. Nothing was too small to make the cut, and I only had one rule: no memories related to romantic relationships. I wanted to intentionally remind myself of all the other fulfilling things in life that aren\u2019t dating. Over Thanksgiving, I sat down, dumped out the contents of the jar, and sorted through my documented happiness.\u201d\n\nWhat training for the New York City marathon taught me about America\n\nBy Annalisa Merelli\n\n\u201cThe US has a reputation for positivity. Growing up, my family and I would make fun of American TV shows where the main character inevitably responds to something tragic by whispering: \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be OK.\u201d No, it\u2019s not! Whatever awful thing that just prompted that reassurance is not going to go away. Life is sorrow\u2014and Europeans know that. Living in America, on the other hand, means being exposed to serious doses of optimism.\u201d\n\nFive years after I saw my friends die for freedom in Syria, the world has given up\n\nBy Loubna Mrie\n\n\u201cI am just one of millions of Syrians who have witnessed death. I spent most of my early twenties photographing the front lines. Each time I left home, I was not sure if I would return safely. But safety had become the least of my worries, because our faith in the cause was that strong. Five years later I am alive, yes. But I am as angry as I was so many years ago, when I watched the death of a man whose only crime had been to speak against injustice.\u201d\n\nEasy access to guns helped me commit murder. I\u2019ve changed, but the loopholes remain\n\nBy John J. Lennon\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but think about what would have happened that night if I hadn\u2019t had access to that gun. Instead, maybe another sequence of events would have unfolded. Perhaps the effects of the Xanax I had taken would have worn off. Perhaps I would have slept on it and felt differently the next day. Perhaps we would have talked it out. Instead, there I was\u2013emotionally empty and angry, and impulsive. Big gun in the trunk. A bit high. It was over in three seconds.\u201d\n\nSid and Nancy and me\n\nBy Euny Hong\n\n\u201cThe willingness to die is not something to be advocated, but such willingness is indicative of an unhealthy society. The death wish is very real and very universal. Punk acknowledged this in a way that no music movement\u2014before or since\u2014ever did. I certainly don\u2019t envy Nancy. But one has to marvel at a person so unafraid to admit to entertaining the thought that life is not for everybody.\u201d\n\nHave a different favorite Ideas piece this year?
