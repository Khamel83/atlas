      "Title": "J.Crew cast normal people as its models at New York Fashion Week, and it was a triumph Quartz",
      "Selection": "The models who stood around the edges of a sun-filled gallery in downtown Manhattan on Sunday (Sept. 11), were not the typical young, porcelain-skinned sort who can effortlessly pull off fuchsia lipstick. Rather, visitors to J.Crew\u2019s presentation at New York Fashion Week met a diverse cast of characters, who varied in their ages, sizes, and skin-tones.\n\nThe American retail giant\u2019s creative director Jenna Lyons said that many were J.Crew staffers, along with their friends and families, and noted that their ages ranged from 13 to 72 years old. One was seven months pregnant. (She wore a tie-front jumpsuit and sensible shoes.)\n\nTheir hair was a little bit messy, but more in a \u201cI\u2019m-a-stylish-human\u201d way than a \u201cmodel-off-duty\u201d way. They mouthed \u201cHello!\u201d to their friends, and sometimes broke character to offer a hug, take a sip of water, or tend to a child.\n\n rather than using professional models, @jcrew used staffers, friends, and family for today's show\u2026and they still look like a j.crew catalog!\n\nA video posted by Jenni Avins (@jenniavins) on Sep 11, 2016 at 1:46pm PDT\n\nThe overall effect was lovely\u2014and smart, in a moment when J.Crew\u2019s sales have been slipping. Loyal customers have complained that more risky, fashion-forward looks are too much of a departure from J.Crew\u2019s casual, preppy roots. The company has gone to great lengths to address this. (Full disclosure: They resurrected a swimsuit from the 1990s after I requested it.)\n\n Our crew in blue: Tamu M., photographer & style obsessive, Natasha J., LA-based baker, and Aaron M., women's designer & Nantucket native.

By styling the presentation on a cast of non-models, J.Crew seemed to be stating loudly, to all those loyal customers: This will look good on you too.",
