      "Selection": "There are 3 million chicken recipes on the internet. We're here to show you the good ones. Win, win.\n\nToday: For nights when you don't have time (and need a bottle of wine).\n\nIt's 4 P.M. and you're daydreaming of dinner\u2014you would kill for a simple roast chicken and a cool glass of white wine. Yes, you decide, that's what I'll\u00a0have for dinner tonight. But as 8 P.M. rolls around and you haven't even fired up the oven, your high hopes of a golden roast get replaced by less time-consuming alternatives,\u00a0like another bowl of pasta with leftover pesto\u2014but they don't have to. Not only does this\u00a0roast chicken take a quarter of\u00a0the time of a traditional roast, but it only uses one pan so you'll have less to clean afterwards.\u00a0The trick to the quicker chicken is two-fold: First, ask your butcher to cut it into 8 parts for you for faster cooking; second, braise it over the stove top for crispy skin so you only have to bake it for 15 minutes. So help yourself to that bottle of wine\u2014just save some for the chicken.\n\nSuper-Quick Roast Chicken with Garlic and White Wine Gravy\n\nServes\u00a04\n\nOne 3 1/3 pound whole free-range, skin-on chicken, cut into eight pieces and backbone removedSea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste1 garlic bulb, halved8 sprigs fresh thyme, divided3 tablespoons olive oil1 cup chicken stock1 cup white wine, divided1 tablespoon all-purpose flour\n\nSave (and print) the full recipe here.\n\nPhoto by\u00a0James Ransom\n\nIs there an undiscovered Food52 chicken recipe you love?
