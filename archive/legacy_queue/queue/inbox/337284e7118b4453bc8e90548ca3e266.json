      "Title": "Amazon Save 20% On Up To $250 Of Spend When Redeeming 1 Membership Rewards Point Frequent Miler",
      "Selection": "Amazon has relaunched one of its best offers, giving a 20% discount on up to $250 of purchases when you redeem at least 1 Membership Rewards point when checking out. Unlike similar past offers though, this sadly doesn\u2019t seem to be working on gift cards.\n\nThe Deal\n\nSave 20% on Amazon on up to $250 of spend when redeeming at least 1 Membership Rewards point.\n\nDirect link to offer (our affiliate link)\n\nKey Terms\n\nThis is a limited time offer. This is a limited time offer. The promotion will end on the earlier of (a) 11:59 PT on 4/20/2020, or (b) the time at which 40,000 customers have redeemed the offer. The promotion button will expire concurrently.\n\nAmazon.com reserves the right to cancel or modify this offer at any time.\n\nOffer is available by invitation only, is non-transferable, is not redeemable for cash, and may not be resold.\n\nOffer applies only to the purchase where Membership Rewards points are used for at least a portion of the purchase and the promotion is applied at checkout.\n\nOffer only applies to products shipped and sold by Amazon.com. Products sold by third-party sellers or other Amazon entities will not qualify for this offer, even if they are \u201cfulfilled by Amazon.com\u201d or \u201cPrime Eligible\u201d.\n\nMaximum benefit you may receive from this offer is $50 per eligible Membership Rewards enrolled card per one account\n\nOffer may not be combined with other offers.\n\nShipping charges may apply to discounted promotional items.\n\nOffer does not apply to purchase of digital content.\n\nOffer discount will be allocated proportionally among all promotional items in your original order. If any of the items in your original order are subsequently returned, your refund will equal the original price of the product, less the proportional amount of the discount. The total discount on the unreturned amount of your original order will then be less than $50.\n\nIf any of the products related to your original order are returned, subject to Amazon\u2019s refund policy, you will receive a refund of the amount charged to your card first, followed by Membership Rewards points.\n\nPromotional codes (including those placed directly in accounts) may not be redeemed for Amazon Gift Cards.\n\nThis promotion is available only to Amazon.com customers with an eligible Membership Rewards points card issued in United States.\n\nPromotional credit is applied before taxes and fees.\n\nIf you violate any of these terms, the offer will be invalid.\n\nQuick Thoughts\n\nA lot of people are avoiding bricks & mortar stores right now, so being able to save up to $50 when ordering on Amazon is a great offer. Be sure to only redeem 1 Membership Rewards point when using this offer as using any more than that is a poor use of your points.\n\nIn the past it was possible to buy $250 worth of gift cards to get the $50 discount, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be working this time. Miles to Memories noticed this difference and I didn\u2019t have any luck ordering a few different types of gift card either. That\u2019s a shame as it was an easy way to max out the offer, but I\u2019m sure many of you can still get the full $50 discount when buying merchandise.\n\nSomething important to note is that only items both shipped and sold by Amazon.com are eligible for the discount. That reduces your selection, especially seeing as there are so many third party resellers on Amazon, but there are still tons of eligible items to choose from. In case you\u2019re not sure how to determine whether an item is eligible or not, look for where it says \u201cShips from and sold by Amazon.com\u201d. This can appear in a couple of places \u2013 sometimes it\u2019s in the main description area\u2026\n\n\u2026while other times it\u2019s in the sidebar beneath the Add To Cart / Buy Now buttons.\n\nIf it says that, you\u2019re good to go. Other times it\u2019ll say that it\u2019s sold by a third party reseller and fulfilled by Amazon \u2013 it\u2019s those types of products that aren\u2019t eligible for the 20% discount.\n\nh/t Miles to Memories\n\nQuick Deal posts are intended to alert readers to deals big and small, with little or no analysis.
