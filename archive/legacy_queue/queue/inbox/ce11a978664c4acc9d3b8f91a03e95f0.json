      "Title": "The Best Places to Go Glamping Around the World The Points Guy",
      "Selection": "If the word\u00a0camping evokes flashlights, heavy backpacks and bring-your-own toilet paper, \u201cglamping\u201d \u2014 or glamorous camping \u2014 is more like vintage oil lamps, massages at your request and in-tent bathrooms with heated floors. While the exact origins of the practice of modern-day luxury camping are unclear, it likely became popular in the UK first before spreading to other countries around the world.\n\n\u201cWhen we started with 200 accommodations three years ago, the majority of those were in the US,\u201d says Jessica Armstrong, head of public relations and partnerships at GlampingHub.com. Now, she says, Canada and Australia are two of the top leaders in their market after the countries grew exponentially over the last couple of years. Global glampsites are on the rise in countries across the globe and their amenities leave almost nothing to be desired. Here are some of our favorites.\n\nClayoquot Wilderness Resort \u2014 Vancouver Island, Canada\n\nAn \u201cen-suite tent\u201d at this British Columbia resort comes with a king-sized bed, private deck and laundry service, but the en-suite bathroom is the real star of the show. Along with spa slippers and robes, it features double sinks, a private outdoor covered shower and a heated floor. Glampers can choose between waterfront, rainforest and sunrise tents, and inside, the light selections alone spell out luxury \u2014\u00a0vintage oil lamps, candles set in antique silver and crystal and, of course, electric light. Guests have access to their own remote-controlled, propane-fueled, cast-iron wood stoves, while dishes like crab ravioli and Cornish game hen make an appearance on the resort menu. In the event guests need additional relaxation, the resort spa offers both hot stone and deep tissue massages.\u00a0All-inclusive rates from $1,283\u2013$2,005 per person per night for a three-night package. Four- and seven-night packages are also available.\n\nImage courtesy of Clayoquot Wilderness Resort.\nAman-i-Khas \u2014 Ranthambore, India\n\nIn a normal camping tent, each person is usually allotted about 15 square feet \u2014\u00a0but at Aman-i-Khas, a resort in northern India, the Mughal-inspired tents measure 1,162 square feet. Fine cotton screens separate each tent into sleeping, dressing, dining and living areas, while the tents boast fully equipped bathrooms with full-size bathtubs, air conditioning and heating, king-size beds, twin writing desks, oversized daybeds, sun decks and, of course, Wi-Fi. Each couple or family of glampers is looked after by their own personal butler, who serves food and drinks and arranges activities. The dining tent offers both Indian and Western dishes, the lounge tent is furnished with banquettes and reading tables, while the spa tent features massages and a step-well pool. For adventurous travelers, there are twice-daily guided safaris into Ranthambore National Park to view tigers, leopards, hyenas, antelopes and more than 350 known species of birds.\u00a0From $1,350 per night.\u00a0\n\nImage courtesy of Aman-i-Khas.\nSingita Sabora Tented Camp \u2014 Grumeti Reserves, Tanzania\n\nIt\u2019s a 1920s-style explorer\u2019s camp in northern Tanzania\u00a0and it\u2019s lavish, with tents housing four-poster canopy beds, Persian rugs, Zanzibari chests and claw-foot bathtubs. Just steps from the tents are the plains, with scattered daybeds for napping and watching the local game from afar. Glampers can enjoy electricity and Wi-Fi, plus a swimming pool and a gym. The camp\u2019s spa offers stress-relief and relaxation treatments, with massage tools made from the wood of the Mwarobaini, a medicinal Swahili tree that\u2019s used to treat more than 40 ailments. Adventurous guests can take advantage of guided safari walks and game drives for the chance to view species like bat-eared foxes, Maasai giraffes, elephants, buffalo, cheetahs, black rhinos and zebras.\u00a0Contact Singita Sabora Tented Camp for rates.\n\nImage courtesy of Singita Sabora Tented Camp.\nJoy\u2019s Camp Shaba \u2014 Shaba National Reserve, Kenya\n\nThis Kenyan camp is located on the site of the former home of Joy Adamson \u2014 naturalist and author of \u201cBorn Free\u201d \u2014 and it partners with a wildlife conservancy to fundraise for the surrounding ecosystem.
