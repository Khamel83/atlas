      "Title": "Philly Fed State Coincident Indexes increased in 41 states in December Calculated Risk",
      "Selection": "From the Philly Fed:\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia has released the coincident indexes for the 50 states for December 2016. In the past month, the indexes increased in 41 states, decreased in two, and remained stable in seven, for a one-month diffusion index of 78. Over the past three months, the indexes increased in 47 states, decreased in two, and remained stable in one, for a three-month diffusion index of 90.\n\nNote: These are coincident indexes constructed from state employment data. An explanation from the Philly Fed:\nThe coincident indexes combine four state-level indicators to summarize current economic conditions in a single statistic. The four state-level variables in each coincident index are nonfarm payroll employment, average hours worked in manufacturing, the unemployment rate, and wage and salary disbursements deflated by the consumer price index (U.S. city average). The trend for each state\u2019s index is set to the trend of its gross domestic product (GDP), so long-term growth in the state\u2019s index matches long-term growth in its GDP.\n\nPhilly Fed.Click on graph for larger image.\nThis is a graph is of the number of states with one month increasing activity according to the Philly Fed. This graph includes states with minor increases (the Philly Fed lists as unchanged).\nIn December 46 states had increasing activity (including minor increases).\nThe downturn in 2015 and 2016, in the number of states increasing, was mostly related to the decline in oil prices. Now that oil prices have recovered somewhat, most states are increasing again. Here is a map of the three month change in the Philly Fed state coincident indicators. This map was all red during the worst of the recession, and almost all green now.\nSource: Philly Fed. Note: For complaints about red / green issues, please contact the Philly Fed.",
