      "Title": "Donald Trump can absolutely ban Muslims from entering the US, without Congress Vox - All",
      "Selection": "After US citizen Rizwan Farook and his Pakistani wife Tashfeen Malik murdered 14 people in San Bernardino on December 2, 2015, Donald Trump called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" \n\nTrump tweaked the plan, but never abandoned it. He later rephrased it as suspending \u201cimmigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur,\u201d vowing to implement it on his first day in office. This covers immigration only, not tourist or student visas, and isn\u2019t explicitly a religious test. But everyone knows where \u201cterror-prone regions\u201d are, and who lives there.\n\nCandidate Trump was never particularly specific on the policy details of how the Muslim ban would work. But with President-elect Trump set to take office in January, and his pledge to implement the ban on day one now about to be put to the test, the question looms: Will he be able to do it, and if so, how?\n\nI put that to several experts on US immigration law. Their answer was unanimous: Trump would be able to implement his ban. In fact, he would be able to do it easily. Congress has already granted wide power to the president to alter immigration rules, so he will not need congressional approval. If the ban is designed properly, it is virtually guaranteed to survive court challenges from liberal advocacy groups determined to derail it.\n\nThe consequences of implementing such a ban, the experts warned, could be very bad. America\u2019s reputation in the world, its economy, and even its struggle with militant groups like ISIS would all suffer. The ban would be a slap in the face to America\u2019s basic commitment to the equal treatment of all people, regardless of their faith or background, and to welcoming in the downtrodden. In the aftermath of Tuesday\u2019s upset, many Muslim Americans are openly wondering whether they will be safe in Trump\u2019s America. \n\nMy mom literally just texted me \"don't wear the Hijab please\" and she's the most religious person in our family....\n\u2014 \u3164 (@harryonmen) November 9, 2016\n\nBut given the state of the law, everything hinges on Donald Trump deciding that those potential problems override what he appears to see as a way of improving American national security. \n\nThe president has nearly unchecked authority to ban people from entering the country\n\nIn 1952, Congress passed something called the Immigration and Nationality Act. It has been amended dozens of times subsequently, and currently exists as a 600-page behemoth with lots of very specific rules.\n\nThere is one section, 212(f), that is particularly relevant to the Muslim ban. It sets out criteria for \u201cexcludable aliens\u201d \u2014 which noncitizens the president can choose, using executive powers, to prevent from entering the United States. Its wording is exceptionally broad:\n\nWhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\n\nTranslated from legalese: The president can ban whoever he wants, however long he wants, for whatever reason he wants. \n\n\u201cAll he has to do is say \u2018I think Muslims are not in the interests of the United States,\u2019\u201d says Stephen Legomsky, a professor emeritus at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis and the former chief counsel for US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nThe formulation that Trump initially used on the campaign trail might not survive a court challenge. The First Amendment has some very clear things to say about religious discrimination, and no president has ever attempted to use 212(f) to implement a religious test on migration. A ban phrased that bluntly could very well be overturned.\n\n\u201cI think there would be a serious constitutional question as [a ban] specifically based on religion would violate the establishment clause of the Constitution,\u201d Legomsky says.\n\nThis is where Trump\u2019s new phrasing, based on nationality, comes into play. Nationality, as my colleague Dara Lind explains, is not a constitutionally protected class like religion. If Trump wanted to exclude anyone who\u2019s a Saudi or Pakistani national from entering the United States, the First Amendment wouldn\u2019t be a barrier.\n\nAnd indeed, it\u2019s quite explicitly legal for the president to discriminate in immigration policy, under something called the \u201cplenary power\u201d doctrine. This basically says that the court should grant extreme deference to the executive when it decides to exclude non-citizens from entering the country, and that non-citizens don\u2019t have equal protection rights in the way that citizens do.\n\n\u201cThe [Supreme] Court quickly came to the conclusion that the judiciary had little or no role in reviewing decisions prohibiting foreigners from entering the country, nor in reviewing decisions to arrest, detain, and deport non-citizens who were already inside the country,\u201d Michael Kagan, a law professor at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, writes.\n\nSo if Trump sticks with his newer formulation, and structures the ban around regions of the world or specific countries, it\u2019s extremely unlikely that any court would stop him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy for him to get at what he was [originally] talking out within legal parameters,\u201d Marshall Fitz, managing director of the pro-immigration Emerson Collective, tells me. \u201cTo make it excessively difficult for Muslims, for people from certain regions of the world, from certain countries to enter.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what Trump\u2019s Muslim ban would actually look like\n\n(Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nHow would Trump\u2019s Muslim ban work in practice?\n\nOne very simple way, according to the experts, is that he could deny anyone who holds a passport from certain countries from entering the United States. He has never been clear on which countries, exactly, would qualify \u2014 whether you need to be a Muslim-majority country, or merely have a large Muslim population, or literally be limited to countries that have experienced or been tied to terror attacks. \n\nRegardless of which countries are included, the system would be very simple: If you\u2019re using a Saudi passport, or an Iraqi one, or a Pakistani one, or an Indonesian one \u2014 sorry, no immigration into America for you.\n\nThis system, though, would be a bit broad \u2014 and might end up banning people Trump would want to admit. This includes Iraqi Christians, computer engineers from Muslim-majority countries hired to code at Silicon Valley firms, or a foreign scholar hired to teach at an American university. If the ban extends beyond immigration, and includes tourists or business travelers, it could ban representatives from some of America\u2019s key allies from even stepping foot in the country.\n\n\u201cThe easiest way to implement it, the least bureaucratically difficult, would be a nationality-based system,\u201d Theresa Cardinal Brown, the director of immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, says. \u201cOf course, that would mean that if you\u2019re a Christian from that country, or someone else, you could also be part of that.\u201d\n\nPresumably, evangelicals would bristle at banning Syrian Christians fleeing ISIS from entering the country. So Trump might, for political reasons, want to create exceptions to the ban. This is tricky, because most countries don\u2019t list religion in their passports.\n\nThe way around this problem is to structure the ban a bit more subtly. Instead of outright saying \u201cban Iraqi immigration,\u201d you could impose additional requirements on anyone trying to emigrate from those countries \u2014 barriers that are so onerous that immigration from these countries would be virtually impossible\n\nOne example, Fitz says, is requiring \u201cmultiple, non-delegable Cabinet level signatures that an individual does not pose a threat to the United States.\u201d Making the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security personally sign off on every entry from a Muslim-majority country would effectively end immigration from those places.\n\n\u201cEven getting one such certification directly from a Cabinet-level secretary would probably be sufficient to bar people,\u201d Fitz says. \u201cWhat secretary has time, bandwidth, [or] resources to individually \u2026 certify that someone is not a security threat?\u201d\n\nThis would avoid the appearance of formally banning non-Muslims from Muslim countries, while in effect accomplishing the same thing. It would be as bureaucratically easy to implement: If you have a passport from a banned country, and don\u2019t have a permission slip from Attorney General Rudy Giuliani, then you can\u2019t immigrate. And to top it all off, Fitz says, it would be constitutionally ironclad.\n\nThere are other ways to accomplish the same goal without simply saying \u201cban Muslims.\u201d Trump could cut staffing resources and funding in State Department offices that cover specific countries, so it would take an incredibly long time to process any immigration requests. He could also make the vetting requirements even more onerous than it already is for potential immigrants from Muslim, to the point where it would be impossible for anyone to satisfy the kind of examination he wants. \n\n Trump could ban immigration from Muslim countries, and he could do it easily.\n\nThe ban would be a disaster\n\nWhile the ban might be easy to do, as a matter of policy, it is not a very good idea.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of doing this could be significant,\u201d Brown says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where the rubber hits the road.\u201d\n\nFor one thing, the US gets a lot of money from immigrants and tourists from the Muslim world. Either by settling in and contributing to the US economy, or by simply visiting and spending their money here, they put dollars in the pockets of American consumers and the US government. \n\nThe costs to specialized industries like technology, which need to attract top notch talent whenever it\u2019s available, could be severe: Steve Jobs, as you might know, was the son of a Muslim immigrant from Syria. It\u2019s hard to put a precise figure on how many would-be Silicon Valley employees would be impacted, since no reliable estimates exist of how many Muslims would be denied entry or would choose not to visit, but the damage to American firms in one of the most competitive industries in the world could be severe.\n\nMore fundamentally, the Muslim ban would screw up the entire global migration system.\n\nInternational migration depends on something called \u201creciprocity:\u201d the idea that if I let your people visit and migrate to my country, you let my people visit and migrate to yours. Countries are free to limit the absolute number of migrants, but putting onerous restrictions on travel and banning people from one place altogether is generally considered a no-no.\n\nThis can lead to retaliation against the country imposing the rules. In the wake of 9/11, for example, the US set up a fingerprinting requirement for foreigners entering the country. Brazil, annoyed at the hassle to its citizens, retaliated, imposing a fingerprinting requirement on Americans entering Brazil. This is how reciprocity works: You limit our citizens\u2019 freedoms, we limit yours\u2019.\n\nBanning people from a truly diverse range of countries could very well provoke serious retaliation. Remember, there are 1.6 billion Muslims around the world. Using nationality as a blunt tool to ban Muslim immigration would punish a hell of a lot of countries. Three of the world\u2019s 20 largest economies \u2014 Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Turkey \u2014 have Muslim majorities (as well as terrorism problems). \n\nYou could easily imagine these countries placing restrictions on American travel in retaliation \u2014 or impose other kinds of restrictions on American trade and business with their countries.\n\nThe potential costs of are incalculable. In a global economy, American corporations depend on being able to send their people wherever they need to go to function, and on exports to foreign markets. If, say, Indonesia responds to a Muslim ban by limiting US travel or restricting American corporations\u2019 rights to operate, this would cause serious damage to the US economy.\n\n\u201cYou start to deny admissions of people from certain countries or regions, and how do they respond? Do they respond by declining to engage in certain kinds of economic activity with the United States? Do they start to bar US corporations from operating in that region?\u201d Fitz asks, rhetorically. \u201cYou can imagine, quickly, how the kind of standoff could escalate.\u201d\n\nThere are national security implications, too. \n\nA lot of these Muslim-majority countries are key partners in America\u2019s counter-terrorism campaigns. In places like Saudi Arabia and Jordan, the US depends on partnerships with local security officials to get intelligence on extremist activity. Washington desperately wants Pakistan, meanwhile, to honor its past promises to protect its nuclear arsenal and allow American drones to operate in its skies.\n\nWhat happens to that cooperation in a world where the United States is openly discriminating against their citizens? And how much more successful does ISIS and al-Qaeda recruiting propaganda, which depends on casting the US as an enemy of Islam, become?\n\nThis is all to say nothing of the morality of treating people as potential terrorists, based solely on their nationality or religion \u2014 how much it contravenes what we see as bedrock American values of tolerance and openness. We\u2019ve violated these principles many times before \u2014 think of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which did exactly what it sounds like. \n\nBut a lot of Americans thought we were past that. It\u2019s up to Donald Trump to decide whether they were right.\n\nWatch: It\u2019s now on America\u2019s institutions to check Trump\n",
