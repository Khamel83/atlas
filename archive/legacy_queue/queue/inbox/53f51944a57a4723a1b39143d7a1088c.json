      "Selection": "In the early 1960s, Richard Feynman gave a series of undergraduate lectures that were collected into a book called the Feynman Lectures on Physics. Absent from the book was a lecture Feynman gave on planetary motion, but a later finding of the notes enabled David Goodstein, a colleague of Feynman\u2019s, to write a book about it: Feynman\u2019s Lost Lecture. From an excerpt of the book published in a 1996 issue of Caltech\u2019s Engineering & Science magazine:\n\nFeynman was a truly great teacher. He prided himself on being able to devise ways to explain even the most profound ideas to beginning students. Once, I said to him, \u201cDick, explain to me, so that I can understand it, why spin one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics.\u201d Sizing up his audience perfectly, Feynman said, \u201cI\u2019ll prepare a freshman lecture on it.\u201d But he came back a few days later to say, \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it. I couldn\u2019t reduce it to the freshman level. That means we don\u2019t really understand it.\u201d\n\nJohn Gruber writes the simple explanations are the goal at Apple as well:\n\nEngineers are expected to be able to explain a complex technology or product in simple, easily-understood terms not because the executive needs it explained simply to understand it, but as proof that the engineer understands it completely.\n\nFeynman was well known for simple explanations of scientific concepts that result a in deeper understanding of the subject matter: e.g. see Feynman explaining how fire is stored sunshine, rubber bands, how trains go around curves, and magnets. Critically, he\u2019s also not shy about admitting when he doesn\u2019t understand something\u2026or, alternately, when scientists as a group don\u2019t understand something. There\u2019s the spin anecdote above and of his explanation of magnets, he says:\n\nI really can\u2019t do a good job, any job, of explaining magnetic force in terms of something else you\u2019re more familiar with, because I don\u2019t understand it in terms of anything else you\u2019re more familiar with.\n\nFeynman was also quoted as saying:\n\nI think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.\n\nPretty interesting thing to hear from a guy who won a Nobel Prize for explaining quantum mechanics better than anyone ever had before. Even when he died in 1988 at the end of a long and fruitful careeer, a note at the top of his blackboard read:\n\nWhat I cannot create, I do not understand.\n\nTags: Apple\u00a0\u00a0 books\u00a0\u00a0 David Goodstein\u00a0\u00a0 Feynman\u2019s Lost Lecture\u00a0\u00a0 John Gruber\u00a0\u00a0 physics\u00a0\u00a0 Richard Feynman\u00a0\u00a0 science\u00a0\u00a0 The Feynman Lectures on Physics",
