      "Selection": "Cole Cuchna thinks you should spend more time with the art you truly love. He is certainly doing just that.\n\nThis week, Cuchna will release the last episode of the second season of his brilliant podcast Dissect, a show in which he takes a deep dive into the musical and thematic content of his favorite albums. Each 30-45 minute episode is dedicated to one song on an album. This season took on Kanye West\u2019s 2010 hip-hop classic My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.\n\nI asked Cuchna, who studied music composition, why he devotes so much time to just one piece of art, when there is so much variety out there to behold. In part, he\u2019s resisting \u201cfalling victim to how we consume things now,\u201d he says. \u201cI found myself scrolling on my phone endlessly at night and feeling kind empty afterwards.\u201d If an album or a piece of art resonates with you, Cuchna says, it\u2019s worth taking the time to linger with it, exploring why it makes you feel that way. The podcast is a way for him to get back in the mindset of deep consideration.\n\nCuchna\u2019s analysis of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is revelatory. In his more than 10-hour analysis of the album, Cuchna reveals how much more there is to the album than initially meets the ear. The surprises begin in Twisted Fantasy\u2019s very first words, recited by the then relatively unknown rapper Nikki Minaj:\n\nYou might think you\u2019ve peeped the scene\nYou haven\u2019t, the real one\u2019s far too mean\nThe watered down one, the one you know\nWas made up centuries ago\nThey made it sound all wack and corny\nYes, it\u2019s awful, blasted boring\nTwisted fictions, sick addictions\nWell, gather \u2019round children, zip it, listen\n\nAlthough I was a fan of the album, I never appreciated the depth of these particular lyrics. On Dissect, Cuchna explains they are a reference to the British children\u2019s author Roahl Dahl\u2019s scary version of the Cinderella story. Kanye is announcing that his album is not about the fairy-tale version of becoming rich and famous, but the \u201cdark twisted\u201d one.\n\nThe record, Cuchna says, is about Kanye\u2019s life spiraling out of control after his mother\u2019s death and the fallout from his jumping on stage to interrupt Taylor Swift\u2019s acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The album ends with the song \u201cLost in the World,\u201d which reflects West\u2019s state of mind at the time.\n\nA sense of resolve\n\nEach podcast episode is rife with examples of West\u2019s compositional virtuosity that would be difficult to appreciate unless, like Cuchna, you\u2019ve spent months repeatedly listening to the album. For example, he points out that the song \u201cDevil in a New Dress\u201d is tonally ambiguous, with alternating minor and major chords (E major and D sharp minor) that never resolve to the \u201chome\u201d chord of the song (G sharp minor). This musical instability reflects the erratic relationship West describes in the song. It is only at the beginning of the next song on the album, \u201cRunaway,\u201d that we hear a G sharp minor chord, and feel some resolution.\n\nCuchna is rapturous when he talks about \u201cRunaway.\u201d He calls it the greatest song on one of the greatest albums every made. We learn that West\u2019s inspiration for the song was Hungarian composer Gyorgy Ligeti\u2019s Musica Ricercata II, a piece highlighted in the movie Eyes Wide Shut. Listen to the first notes of each song and it is unmistakable.\n\nCuchna also highlights how the beginning of the song features a clever rhythmic trick. We assume the piano notes at the start are on the first and third beats of a traditional 4/4 time signature, but then the bass and drums come in and we realize the piano figure is centered on the 2nd and 4th notes. This may sound technical, but in his podcast Cuchna does a great job of showing how important details like this are to the listening experience. To that end, Dissect also discusses how \u201cRunaway\u201d includes exemplary uses of overtones and motivic development (pdf).\n\n\u201cRunaway\u201d ends with West\u2019s greatest trick. The last note of the song is an E, and then the next song, \u201cHell of a Life,\u201d starts on a B flat. The interval from a E to a B flat is what\u2019s called a tritone. \u201cThe tritone is notorious in music history,\u201d Cuchna explains. \u201cIt was banned by certain religions and in the 17th century, and called the \u2018devil in music\u2019 due to the way it sounds.\u201d (You will hear this interval a lot in heavy metal music.) The tritone makes sense as a bridge from the cathartic and apologetic \u201cRunaway\u201d to the debauched \u201cHell of a Life,\u201d in which West talks about his lust for a porn star.\n\nHow is Cuchna so sure this is intentional? He says there are just too many examples like it for them all to be coincidences. Plus, Kanye\u2019s primary collaborator on the album, Mike Dean, is a classically trained composer who would be well aware of these musical references.\n\nHidden meanings\n\nThe first season of Dissect, dedicated to Kendrick Lamar\u2019s To Pimp a Butterfly, is nearly as good as the second. Cuchna\u2019s analysis highlights the narrative and lyrical complexity of Lamar\u2019s album, revealing the double- and triple-meanings hidden throughout. After spending months with the To Pimp a Butterfly, Cuchna was blown away by Lamar\u2019s ability to be \u201cartful and meaningful, but remain appealing on a mass level.\u201d\n\nThe first two seasons of Dissect were about hip-hop albums because Cuchna felt that the genre deserved more academic analysis. He is interested in exploring other types of music for future seasons. He says he\u2019s interested in dissecting albums by Radiohead, Beyonce, Bon Iver, or maybe even a Beethoven symphony (he is partial to the 3rd, 5th, and 9th). The most common request from fans is that he do a Frank Ocean album.\n\nAfter speaking with Cuchna, I couldn\u2019t help but feel jealous of the way he experiences life and art. Cuchna told me that before going to college to study music full-time in his mid 20s (he is now 34), he spent six years taking art and philosophy classes at community college in his hometown of Sacramento, while working for a coffee roaster. \u201cI just took classes because I liked learning,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a degree in mind.\u201d\n\nAfter school, he would listen to Great Courses lectures, which are audio recordings of college-level classes. He particularly loved the music composition professor Robert Greenberg\u2019s class on Dimitri Shostakovich, Cuchna\u2019s favorite composer. It served as a model for Dissect.\n\n\u201cPeople should follow the art they are attracted to,\u201d Cuchna says. \u201cThere is a reason that album or painting is resonating with you. I know from experience that if you don\u2019t give it your full attention, you won\u2019t get everything you could get out of it. I hope Dissect can provide the structure for someone to take that time, or inspire them to create that structure in their own life.\u201d\n",
