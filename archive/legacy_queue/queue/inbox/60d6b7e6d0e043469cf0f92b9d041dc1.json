      "Selection": "Jeff Bezos is making a name for himself in the world of charity. | Nicole Craine/WireImage\n\nIs that good? Is that bad? It\u2019s definitely unusual.\n \nWhen starting Amazon more than two decades ago, Jeff Bezos decided to build a reputation as an aggressive micromanager.\n\nWhen starting the Day One Families Fund, his new billion-dollar charity, Bezos decided to try something remarkably different.\n\nJust after he became the world\u2019s richest man one year ago, Bezos, who had until then been conspicuously absent from the world of serious charitable giving, announced that he would give $2 billion to bolster homelessness services and early childhood education in the US. He quickly sent $100 million to two dozen well-regarded nonprofits working to provide shelter to homeless families across the country.\n\nAnd since then, he has done something that even the nonprofits receiving his millions remark is highly unusual: He has given them life-changing money with virtually no restrictions, formal vetting, or oversight, according to Recode\u2019s interviews with eight of those funded by him and others familiar with his donations.\n\nFunders of Bezos\u2019s stature typically cast an open call for proposals, spending months poring over applications from nonprofits and sometimes insisting on site visits, interviews, and reams of financial data. Bezos\u2019s team instead quietly cold-called the nonprofits he was already interested in backing, asked them for a few 500-word answers, and then wired them millions of dollars in cash or Amazon shares within about six weeks of making initial contact.\n\nFunders require nonprofits to fill out reports as often as every quarter, outlining the recipients progress on the funder\u2019s own favorite dozen-plus metrics. Bezos does require an annual report, but he doesn\u2019t even send a rubric; nonprofits can effectively create their own accountability and send him whatever type of update they want.\n\nFunders are also prone to placing copious restrictions on their money to ensure it is spent on whatever it is they care about. What does Bezos do? He\u2019s taken \u201cno strings attached\u201d to the extreme, effectively letting the nonprofits spend the money on anything that offers shelter to homeless families, even if the initiative was nowhere to be found on the original applications or grant agreements.\n\nThat all might sound pretty wild. Giving $100 million to nonprofits based on little provided information and then letting them run with it sounds, on its face, like a recipe for disaster. It conjures the image of fat-and-happy charity leaders milking extravagant salaries from others\u2019 generosity, or profligate spending on extraneous overhead \u2014 or even outright fraud, such as when the head of the United Way embezzled $1.2 million from his foundation.\n\nTo be sure, Bezos\u2019s approach is a wonderful arrangement for the nonprofits. Almost too wonderful. Big money, little accountability, and the marketing power of the world\u2019s wealthiest man to boot? Of course they rave about it.\n\n\u201cIt may seem kind of crazy to have this rare opportunity and to not have the intensive oversight you\u2019d typically expect with a funder,\u201d said Vera Beech, who runs Community Rebuilders, a homeless shelter group based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. \u201cBut for us, it\u2019s absolutely a dream come true.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may seem kind of crazy to have this rare opportunity and to not have the intensive oversight you\u2019d typically expect with a funder\u201d\n\nBut for everyone else?\n\nWell, here\u2019s the surprise: Multiple experts told Recode this strategy actually makes a lot of sense. They think philanthropies should give nonprofits substantially more leeway.\n\nRisks abound, to be sure. The swiftness with which Bezos is parting with the money could backfire \u2014 and it does also contradict some of his public rhetoric about his approach to giving.\n\n\u201cThere [are] a lot of mishaps, a lot of problems, that can occur if there\u2019s not adequate oversight,\u201d said Daniel Borochoff, who advocates for more accountability as the head of CharityWatch. \u201cIf someone was stealing from an Amazon warehouse, I\u2019m sure his people would be all over it. But if people were stealing from the shelter pantry, the mission-focused charity staff and volunteers might not.\u201d\n\nOne nonprofit leader who received millions from the Day One Fund said he felt Bezos\u2019s approach was \u201cpuzzling.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no one that we partner with \u2014 that would fund us \u2014 that is this hands-off. Especially at this significant level of funding,\u201d the leader said. \u201cIt\u2019s very different from our typical funding relationships, you bet.\u201d\n\nBezos representatives declined to comment for this story.\n\nThe Amazon founder has indicated he intends to be more hands-on with his other billion dollar initiative, a preschool program that Bezos has said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be operating.\u201d He considers the homelessness program \u201ca more traditional grant-making\u201d model. \n\nBut the entire world is scrutinizing Bezos\u2019s first serious foray into charity, both because of his new figurehead power as the world\u2019s wealthiest person and because of how parsimonious he has historically been with his donations. The Amazon founder, along with his then-wife MacKenzie, have long countered that they did not want to rush into philanthropy \u2014 and have been willing to take withering criticism in order to avoid knee-jerk donations.\n\nJeff Bezos said little about his philanthropic giving until confronted with questions from the New York Times in the summer of 2017, after he tweeted a \u201crequest for ideas\u201d just before briefly becoming the richest person in the world for the first time. He then spent 15 months mulling those ideas before announcing the Day One Fund. \n\n\u201cI have a lot of ideas about philanthropy \u2014 that I\u2019m not ready to share or talk about,\u201d Bezos told Charlie Rose nine years ago when asked whether he would consider signing the Giving Pledge (he still hasn\u2019t). \u201cThere are a lot of interesting unknowns. And sometimes I think we try to solve problems before we understand the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would you do if we gave you $5 million?\u201d\n\nThe lack of accountability built into Bezos\u2019s system places an enormous amount of weight on the front end: If you\u2019re going to give nonprofits an exceedingly long leash, you\u2019ve got to make sure you choose the right nonprofits in the first place.\n\nBut the strangeness of Bezos\u2019s philanthropy begins with the way he chose his first two dozen nonprofits.\n\nFor Beth Vann-Turnbull, the head of Housing Families First near Richmond, Virginia, it began with three missed calls while she was on vacation.\n\nThe calls came from Paul Dauber, Bezos\u2019s personal lawyer, who, despite not working for the philanthropy, has been the primary point of contact for nonprofits like Housing Families First. He asked leaders like Vann-Turnbull an easy question: How would you like to be considered for a grant of up to $5 million?\n\n\u201cThis must be going to everyone in the country who works in homeless services,\u201d Vann-Turnbull recalls thinking.\n\nTo a person, these calls came completely out of the blue. They had an air of mystery. But behind the scenes at the Day One Fund, an advisory board of a dozen experts on homelessness had culled together this list from their personal networks.\n\nThis was not a typical open process, where a foundation posts a public call for proposals and patiently works through the submissions. Observers have noted there\u2019s a risk that an elite group of informants could be biasing Bezos\u2019s work toward their favored projects, rather than honestly and comprehensively assessing who exactly has the best idea. (Bezos has praised his advisory board as \u201cexperts\u201d in the field.)\n\nEven the invited applicants were nervous. Bezos was asking for a proposal within two weeks. Often, nonprofits can spend months laboring over every decimal point on a grant application, and for far smaller grants than $5 million.\n\nLucky for them, Bezos wasn\u2019t asking for much: just a few general questions about their nonprofits and then, quite starkly, a 500-word answer about how they\u2019d spend the money.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll apply for a grant for $5,000 and it\u2019s five times the length of this one,\u201d said Darlene Newsom, who runs UMOM New Day Centers, a nonprofit that operates homeless shelters in Phoenix. \u201cI was a little bit in awe about it.\u201d\n\nNearly every grantee who spoke with Recode called the abridged process \u201cunusual.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even call it an application. It was a back-of-the-envelope idea,\u201d said one person who received money. \u201c\u2018What would you do if we gave you $5 million? Okay! You\u2019re in!\u2019 It was quite strange.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018What would you do if we gave you $5 million? Okay! You\u2019re in!\u2019 It was quite strange.\u201d\n\nThere would be no other questions after that five-page application. No site visits. No interviews. The next time they\u2019d hear from Bezos\u2019s staff, the only question was whether they\u2019d like their donation in cash or Amazon stock. A lump sum payment arrived just before Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cI would love for Jeff Bezos to be there.\u201d But don\u2019t count on it.\n\nThat brings us to the next way in which the Day One Fund radically differs from the charity orthodoxy: Bezos basically vanished from the day-to-day experience of the nonprofits since handing them the money. That\u2019s not unprecedented, but charity leaders say they\u2019ve rarely, if ever, seen a donor of this size be so absent.\n\nHe has no minders routinely checking in with the 24 executive directors of the nonprofits he backed. In fact, with no full-time staff working exclusively on the billion-dollar project, Bezos has largely outsourced his non-legal interactions with his charities to a trade group, the National Alliance to End Homelessness, which has organized a few calls and meetings at conferences between various grantees, the nonprofits told Recode.\n\nThat\u2019s left some longing for more direct interactions with Bezos\u2019s team, which can sometimes be unresponsive to their outreach, sources say, and hasn\u2019t seized on some open invitations from multiple grantees to their homeless shelters (which isn\u2019t terribly uncommon).\n\nThere\u2019s a practical reason these nonprofits want to show off for Bezos: This lack of a real relationship is a missed opportunity for them to secure future funding from Bezos down the line, multiple leaders told Recode.\n\nOther nonprofits just want to establish even a scintilla of a personal connection with the billionaire who gave their organization its largest gifts ever.\n\nNewsom said her board members have even taken to sending handwritten personal cards to Bezos\u2019s house to say thanks. She\u2019s planning to invite Bezos to their annual gala in October.\n\n\u201cI would love for Jeff Bezos to be there,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat if Jeff Bezos is right?\n\nAll signs at this point indicate that Bezos has little interest in overseeing their gala from the dais \u2014 or overseeing anything at all, really.\n\nBezos\u2019s team\u2019s lack of engagement reflects his broader strategy to effectively hand the nonprofits the money and get out of the way.\n\nTo say this is far from how typical funders like to do things is an understatement. Governments especially love to attach endless conditions to the money they disburse, part of a conventional wisdom baked in the 1980s that bloated nonprofits were not spending nearly enough of their funding on programming and that more supervision could help combat fraud.\n\nAnd despite escalating criticism from nonprofit leaders and academics about attaching these strings, donors continue to dangle money that comes with conditions upon conditions upon conditions.\n\nVu Le, a nonprofit leader who runs an influential blog on philanthropy issues, told Recode that donors\u2019 obsessive focus on overhead costs serves to \u201cinfantilize\u201d nonprofits. He compared his industry\u2019s conundrum to volunteer firefighters arriving at the scene of a blaze.\n\n\u201cEvery three or four steps, people want to make sure the money I\u2019m giving you is spent on the water or on the hose. I also want to make sure that any of the money isn\u2019t spent on the rent for your fire station,\u201d Le said. \u201cWe spend all this time trying to answer these stupid questions that we\u2019re not fighting the fires.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe spend all this time trying to answer these stupid questions that we\u2019re not fighting the fires\u201d\n\nTo be clear, the Bezos money has to be spent on family homelessness measures, but there are very few restrictions under that umbrella. The grant agreements that Bezos and the nonprofits signed do not legally limit how they spend the money, and multiple nonprofits told Recode that they\u2019ve changed some of their plans after receiving Bezos\u2019s gifts.\n\n\u201cThis is really the most flexible funding that we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Beech. \u201cI could understand that some people would look for that traditional response. For us, we\u2019re like, \u2018Welcome to the modern world.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor example, rather than splicing the money in a series of payments, nonprofits received all the money at once. If they wanted to spend it all right away on a new fancy building, they could.\n\nAnother example: In June, the grantees submitted their first annual report to the Bezos fund. Reporting is drudgery in the world of charities, with each funder asking for their own idiosyncratic metrics to be met with on own forms, no matter how much money they actually gave. Funders can ask for reports as often as every quarter.\n\nBezos let his nonprofits send in whatever report they wanted. No form.\n\nIf any of the 24 nonprofits \u2014 or the hundreds of others that Bezos will likely choose over the next decade \u2014 flops fantastically, critics will be quick to point out that this lack of accountability was a rookie mistake. Some may even call out the other Seattle-based tech billionaire, Bill Gates, who was criticized as too trusting of nonprofits in the early years of his philanthropic efforts. Gates changed course and now requires his grantees to go through a careful vetting process.\n\nBut to many experts in the nonprofit space, the hope is that Bezos\u2019s emerging strategy will challenge the conventional wisdom that a long leash is a bad thing for a nonprofit. Old-guard philanthropy may snicker, but so did the other sectors that Bezos has decimated during his reign at Amazon. \n\nAnd the egg is on their face, not his.\n\nRecode and Vox have joined forces to uncover and explain how our digital world is changing \u2014 and changing us.
