      "Selection": "Rising return rates are terrible for the environment, and for workers. But that\u2019s not why brands are making it more difficult.\n \nCustomers of the online fast-fashion brand Asos were informed last week that the site would be changing its notoriously lax return policy. \u201cWe need to make sure our free returns remain sustainable for us and for the environment,\u201d the email read, \u201cso if we notice an unusual pattern, we might investigate and take action.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a company that has long made returning items far more convenient than others \u2014 every shipment includes a free return label, the bags are easy to repackage, and refunds are quickly made in full. That\u2019s part of the reason why Asos is one of the most successful and fastest-growing brands in fashion: Because clothes are extremely cheap and sizing and quality vary widely, buying multiple items with the assumption that some or most of it will be returned is a typical strategy for customers. \n\nBut the move was a crackdown on such serial returners, and it\u2019s just one example of a shift among businesses to make returning the stuff you buy \u2014 but don\u2019t want \u2014 a little harder. \n\nReturns are a growing environmental and labor issue\n\nIt\u2019s actually a good thing that the return backlash has arrived. Returns, particularly those made online, are terrible for the environment: They typically require transport by medium- and heavy-duty trucks, vehicles that make up nearly a quarter of the carbon footprint caused by transportation, which in 2016 overtook power plants as the biggest producer of carbon dioxide emissions. \n\nReturned items often don\u2019t even get restocked \u2014 instead, many end up in landfills. As Mashable notes, returns and excess inventory cost the environment 4 billion pounds of landfill waste every year. \n\nThese effects are exacerbated by the fact that people are buying and returning items online more than ever. During the 2015 holiday season, customers returned $69 billion worth of goods; over the 2018 holiday season, that number had jumped to $94 billion. And since return rates are higher on online purchases versus those made in stores, that number will doubtlessly continue to grow as more people shop online. \n\nThe negative effects of returns aren\u2019t limited to the environment: More returns means more stress on the employees who then must process them. CNBC reported that returns contributed to a huge boom in the warehouse industry since 2012, so much so that \u201creverse logistics\u201d \u2014 corporate jargon for \u201cdealing with returns\u201d \u2014 is the top new user of warehouse space in the US, accounting for 700 million square feet nationally. \n\nKerem Yucel / AFP\n\nDemonstrators held a protest at the Amazon fulfillment center in Shakopee, Minnesota on December 14, 2018 to demand better working conditions.\n\nThis puts an extra strain on people employed in those warehouses, where working conditions are already reportedly grueling. One Amazon worker spoke to Vox\u2019s Chavie Lieber about their experience with brutal hours, dystopian surveillance systems, and inhumane policies. Meanwhile, attempts to unionize at Amazon have been consistently thwarted by the company, which was recently valued at more than a trillion dollars. \n\nWhile the human cost is far greater, of course, returns are also bad for business: Aside from lost profit, they also increase labor costs for companies, and according to Appriss, a retail tracking database, they cause markdowns and out-of-stocks to increase. \n\nWhy companies are making returns more difficult\n\nIt\u2019s that last bit that provides the most insight into why so many companies are discouraging customers from returning items. Revenue loss, combined with fears about return fraud, which is estimated to cost the US retail industry about $18.4 billion per year, is what Asos is targeting with its new policy. \n\nThe London-based e-tailer, which carries more than 850 brands, states in its new rules that the changes will only affect a shopper if they are \u201cactually wearing their purchases and then returning them or ordering and returning loads \u2014 way, waaay more than even the most loyal ASOS customer would order.\u201d If they do, it explains, it might deactivate that customer\u2019s account.\n\nBut for many Asos shoppers, the ability to buy and then return the mostly cheap, often confusingly sized items is the main draw. The BBC spoke to some of these serial returners last year, who tend to return most of what they buy online, whether they get a high from it or because of the nature of online shopping. \u201cYou see models wearing things and it looks fantastic on them,\u201d one said, laughing, and added that they don\u2019t look the same on her. \n\nWhen you buy an ASOS jumpsuit thinking you'll look like this, but you end up looking like this. pic.twitter.com/wZDOxvCeQi\n\u2014 Christina McDermott-McGarrigle (@ChristinaMcMc) June 8, 2016\n\nNaturally, Asos customers were quick to complain. \u201cMaybe if ur clothes actually arrived fitting like they\u2019re supposed to I wouldn\u2019t return so much god damn crap,\u201d one woman wrote on Twitter. \u201cDid anyone else feel more than a little threatened by the recent email from @ASOS regarding returns?\u201d asked another. \u201cEspecially as a fat person, they\u2019re practically my only clothes retailer option and I STILL have to order and return multiple items!\u201d\n\nDespite the brand\u2019s assurances that it would only affect the most extreme returners, many on Twitter have claimed within the past few days that they\u2019ve been banned for sending back just a couple items. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the only tactic used by clothing brands to curb the volume of returns. Everlane employs a \u201crestocking fee\u201d of $6 when customers make online returns to cover the cost of shipping and restocking, while Anthropologie also charges a flat $5.95 for shipping on online returns. \n\nBecause newer and smaller businesses don\u2019t always have the resources of bigger ones, they\u2019re disproportionally affected by rising return rates \u2014 yet lots of companies do this: Verizon, for instance. The online thrift store ThredUp, which charges a $1.99 fee with every return, explains that a return must go through the same process of inspection and quality assurance as when it arrived for it to be relisted on the site, which costs the company more money. \n\nSephora also made headlines last year when the Wall Street Journal discovered that the makeup behemoth was giving stores the ability to ban certain customers from returning items, confirming years of suspicions on beauty message boards. It, along with more than 34,000 other stores from Best Buy to Home Depot, had been using a service called the Retail Equation, which tracks customers\u2019 returning habits via their driver\u2019s licenses. \n\nEven L.L. Bean, the Maine-based outdoor gear brand generally considered to be on the greener and more sustainable end of the spectrum, changed its famous no-receipt needed lifetime return policy, not to save the polar bears but to save itself from being scammed. \n\nWhile making returns more difficult for customers may actually do a bit of good for warehouse workers and the environment, it\u2019s important to note that that\u2019s likely not the reason these companies don\u2019t want you to return their stuff. It\u2019s because returns add an entirely new, expensive layer to the online shopping process, and it\u2019s bad for bottom lines. \n\nHugely popular online retailers like Amazon, meanwhile, probably aren\u2019t going to change their generous return policies and lightning-fast shipping any time soon. For a trillion-dollar company, the priority is always going to be on keeping you \u2014 at the expense of its employees and the earth \u2014 happy. \n\nWant more stories from The Goods by Vox?
