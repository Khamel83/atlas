      "Title": "The Top Interior Design Trends, State by State Food52",
      "Selection": "Last month, furniture company Joybird decided to determine the most popular interior design trends across America. The company\u2019s methodology involved compiling a list of 15 different design trends, from bohemian to coastal to shabby chic, and then combing through Google Trends data to assess each category's search popularity over the course of the past year.\n\nPhoto\u00a0by Joybird\n\nThe company\u2019s findings? In terms of popularity, bohemian won out as the most searched overall in the country. It commanded eight states, from Alaska to New Jersey, scattered across regions. Victorian wasn\u2019t too far behind, the most popular in seven states. Traditional decor is hot in Hawaii; Idaho\u2019s fallen for shabby chic. The lone state to pine for coastal design was South Carolina, while modern farmhouse was only popular in Utah.\n\nOf course, Joybird is working off the assumption that search frequency corresponds to actual popularity, so take these findings with a dose of skepticism. Browse the full list below. What most compels me: Rustic wasn\u2019t the most popular design search term in any state, nor was \u201ccasual modern,\u201d a category that didn\u2019t even merit a place on the key of the company\u2019s visualization! Poor casual modern. Always a bridesmaid.\n\nAlabama:\u00a0Bohemian\n\nAlaska:\u00a0Bohemian\n\nArizona:\u00a0Traditional\n\nArkansas:\u00a0Shabby chic\n\nCalifornia:\u00a0Transitional\n\nColorado:\u00a0Industrial\n\nConnecticut:\u00a0Victorian\n\nDelaware:\u00a0Victorian\n\nFlorida:\u00a0Contemporary\n\nGeorgia:\u00a0Bohemian\n\nHawaii:\u00a0Traditional\n\nIdaho:\u00a0Shabby chic\n\nIllinois:\u00a0Contemporary\n\nIndiana:\u00a0Victorian\n\nIowa:\u00a0Industrial\n\nKansas:\u00a0Contemporary\n\nKentucky:\u00a0Traditional\n\nLouisiana:\u00a0Shabby chic\n\nMaine:\u00a0Victorian\n\nMaryland:\u00a0Contemporary\n\nMassachusetts:\u00a0Transitional\n\nMichigan:\u00a0Industrial\n\nMinnesota:\u00a0Mid-Century Modern\n\nMississippi:\u00a0Shabby chic\n\nMissouri:\u00a0Victorian\n\nMontana:\u00a0Bohemian\n\nNebraska:\u00a0Victorian\n\nNevada:\u00a0Victorian\n\nNew Hampshire:\u00a0Bohemian\n\nNew Jersey:\u00a0Bohemian\n\nNew Mexico:\u00a0Art Deco\n\nNew York:\u00a0Contemporary\n\nNorth Carolina:\u00a0Contemporary\n\nNorth Dakota:\u00a0Bohemian\n\nOhio: Industrial\n\nOklahoma:\u00a0Vintage\n\nOregon:\u00a0Industrial\n\nPennsylvania:\u00a0Vintage\n\nRhode Island:\u00a0Vintage\n\nSouth Carolina:\u00a0Coastal\n\nSouth Dakota:\u00a0Western\n\nTennessee:\u00a0Shabby chic\n\nTexas:\u00a0Contemporary\n\nUtah:\u00a0Modern farmhouse\n\nVermont:\u00a0Vintage\n\nVirginia:\u00a0Contemporary\n\nWashington:\u00a0Mid-Century Modern\n\nWest Virginia:\u00a0Bohemian\n\nWisconsin:\u00a0Industrial\n\nWyoming:\u00a0Western\n\nHave thoughts on the most popular design in your state?
