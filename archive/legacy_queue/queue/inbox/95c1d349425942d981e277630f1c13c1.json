      "Title": "How Billionaires Rule Our Schools",
      "Selection": "The cost of K\u201312 public schooling in the United States comes to well over $500 billion per year. So, how much influence could anyone in the private sector exert by controlling just a few billion dollars of that immense sum? Decisive influence, it turns out. A few billion dollars in private foundation money, strategically invested every year for a decade, has sufficed to define the national debate on education; sustain a crusade for a set of mostly ill-conceived reforms; and determine public policy at the local, state, and national levels. In the domain of venture philanthropy\u2014where donors decide what social transformation they want to engineer and then design and fund projects to implement their vision\u2014investing in education yields great bang for the buck.",
