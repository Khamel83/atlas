      "Title": "A useful Google Chrome extension autocorrects \u201calt-right\u201d to \u201cneo-Nazi\u201d Quartz",
      "Selection": "Since the election of Donald Trump, the controversial term \u201calternative-right\u201d or \u201calt-right\u201d has emerged in mainstream media to describe a loose configuration of people who rally behind incendiary, white nationalist polemic in the US.\n\nBut an anonymous New York City-based designer says that the use of \u201calt-right\u201d instead of \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d is nothing more than linguistic sanitation, and has created two Google Chrome extensions to fix that. The extensions automatically replace all instances of the term \u201calt-right\u201d on the internet with \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d or \u201cNeo-Nazi.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis gentle sounding name is the rebranding of White Supremacy and White Nationalism, and its normalization must be stopped,\u201d the designer, operating under the pseudonym George Zola wrote on his/her website.\n\nRebranded hatred is still hatred. Rebranded white supremacy is still white supremacy. Rebranded nazism is still nazism. #StopNormalizing\n\n\u2014 #STOPNORMALIZING (@STOPNORMALIZING) November 29, 2016\n\nHe\u2019s not the only one to call out the term \u201calt-right.\u201d On Nov. 28, the AP updated its style guide stating that \u201calt-right\u201d should only be used in quotation marks and with a definition. In a blog post, John Daniszewski, AP\u2019s vice president for standards noted that the news agency has simply described such beliefs as \u201cracist, neo-Nazi or white supremacist\u201d in the past.\n\nThe term \u201cAlternative-Right\u201d originates with Richard Spencer, president of the far right advocacy group National Policy Institute (NPI) who used it in a speech in 2010 speech and recently led members in a \u201cHail Trump\u201d salute, as the Atlantic captured on video. It was propagated by fringe media exec Steve Bannon, now a senior strategist for Trump.\n\nThe free web browser extension for \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d was downloaded 1,200 times on its first day, Nov. 16. As of Nov. 29, links to the extension had reportedly been shared 63,000 times on Facebook.\n\nZola tells Quartz that he developed the Neo-Nazi version in response for a clamor for the more loaded term, and says he\u2019s focusing on getting the extensions ready for FireFox and Safari.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how much further we\u2019ll take the Chrome Extension approach, we have larger goals of making noise,\u201d Zola explains. \u201cAny way we can prompt conversation and get people to consider the importance of their own word choice as well as question the word choice of the media is what we\u2019re aiming for.\u201d\n\nZola also shares that the response to his self-initiated political protest has been shockingly positive. \u201cWhen we started this, I expected a lot of hate mail. However, the response has been overwhelmingly positive and personally touching,\u201d he says. The project has even drawn out personal stories from those affected by Nazi occupation. \u201cWe\u2019ve received messages of hope\u2026we\u2019ve inspired them by presenting simple yet powerful messages of defiance.\u201d\n",
