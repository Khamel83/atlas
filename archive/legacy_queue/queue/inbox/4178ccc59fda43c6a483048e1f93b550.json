      "Selection": "Do you love travel? Do you also love animals? Then you\u2019re in luck, because today we\u2019re diving into one of my absolute favorite travel services. I\u2019m talking about Trusted Housesitters, a free program that matches people needing house and pet-sitters with people looking for a place to stay while traveling.\n\nOf course, it isn\u2019t totally\u00a0free. The service costs $118/year for those looking simply to housesit or find sitters, or $148/year if you\u2019d like to have both options. In return, you get access to the site and its thousands of listings, which vary from Victorian-style lodges in New Zealand to Italian villas in Tuscany.\n\nI know, it sounds too good to be true. But it makes sense when you think about it. People have pets, and people like to travel. Trusted Housesitters strikes two birds with one stone by allowing those wanting to see the world to do so by exchanging petsitting services for free lodging. It\u2019s a win-win.\n\nThere are tons of different ways to search the site, with durations from one day all the way to six\u00a0months.\u00a0You can even choose what kind of animals you\u2019d like to take care of. And if you don\u2019t like animals at all? There\u2019s an option for that, too:\n\nAnd if you\u2019re concerned about safety, the site has verification measures for all sitters, and the more steps you take for verification, the more likely you are to be chosen for a housesit.\n\nThe site even comes with insurance for homeowners, in case of accidents:\n\nI\u2019ve used Trusted Housesitters countless times when traveling (as a pet- and home-owner) and had wonderful experiences. In fact, just a week ago I used the service to have a couple watch my dog while I traveled to Kazakhstan. It\u2019s great, not only because it\u2019s free, but because in-house dog sitting means that your own beloved pets don\u2019t have to deal with the unfamiliarity of boarding.\n\nEven my grandparents have traveled around the world using this service, and they are absolute fans. Here\u2019s what they have to say about sitting with Trusted Housesitters: \u201cIt\u2019s a very different experience seeing a new location from the eyes of a local and to have the convenience of a whole home in a real residential neighborhood. There\u2019s also nothing quite like the eager greeting you get from the critters in your care when you return from a day of sightseeing!\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get much better than that.\n\nSign up for the free daily TPG newsletter for more travel tips!\n\nFeature photo\u00a0courtesy of fixnfly/Flickr\n",
