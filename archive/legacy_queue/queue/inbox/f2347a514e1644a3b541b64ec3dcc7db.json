      "Selection": "Today, we\u2019re talking about the most perfect cookware material on Earth: stainless steel. Before you smash that comment button, I want to make it clear that I\u2019m not disparaging cast iron. I would never do such a thing. My 12-inch cast iron skillet is my very large, heavy son and I love him dearly (he turned 8 in July, thank you for asking). Here\u2019s the truth, though: stainless steel is the only truly all-purpose cookware material you can buy, which is why I recommend it above all others.\n\nIt Just Works\n\nEven, Responsive Heat\n\nStainless steel\u2019s amazing versatility lies in its responsiveness to heat adjustments. Cast iron delivers beautifully consistent cooking temperatures, but it takes forever to adapt to temperature changes. A well-constructed stainless pan distributes heat evenly and releases it quickly enough to take a covered pot of rice from a rolling boil to a low simmer without boiling over or scorching the bottom.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2xhDzN3\n\nCracked has rounded up five simple things bad cooks (or cooking newbies) do wrong, and among them\u2026\n\nRead more\n\nNon-Corrosive and Oven-Safe\n\nWhen it comes to stew, there\u2019s no substitute for a long, slow oven braise\u2014and there\u2019s no better vessel for that than a covered stainless steel pan. This is especially true for something acidic like bolognese sauce, which you can\u2019t safely cook in cast iron or aluminum. My personal favorite pan for oven braises is the five-quart deep saut\u00e9 pan I got in my Cook\u2019s Standard set (which I\u2019ll talk more about later). Its wide base makes it ideal for browning ingredients in a single layer, while its straight sides accommodate a surprising amount of food. Throw on a lid and it can go straight into the oven for a nice long braise, which brings me to my next point.\n\nMulti-Use Lids\n\nI love my cast iron skillet with a fierceness matched only by my hatred for its awful hat. Trying to find a place to put down an oven-hot, dripping-with-condensation cast iron lid so you can check on your stew is a huge pain. Cleaning one, and then finding a place for it to dry, is even worse. Stainless steel lids are oven-safe too, but they\u2019re lightweight, easy to maneuver, and dishwasher-friendly. Plus, there\u2019s often some overlap with pan diameters in stainless sets, so one lid fits two or more pots. Finally, I love how easy they are to store \u2014 I use an IKEA accordion rack and it\u2019s perfect.\n\nDurable and Easy to Clean\n\nThe difference between a chef and a cook is access to a dishwasher (the human, not the machine). If you\u2019re in charge of your own cleanup, you need cookware that can be cleaned quickly, easily, and on your schedule. Unlike cast iron, non-stick, and carbon-steel pans, stainless ticks every one of these boxes and you can put it in the damn dishwasher (the machine, not the human; the latter is assault). Should you burn something on that\u2019s not responding to a regular soap-and-water scrub, don\u2019t panic, because God gave us Barkeeper\u2019s Friend for exactly this reason.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2ueCsOI\n\nIn the abstract\u2014which is to say, if you were an extremely rich person with an army of servants to\u2026\n\nRead more\n\nThere\u2019s Nothing it Can\u2019t Do\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, stainless steel is truly all-purpose, but it does some things exceptionally well. Here are my favorite applications.\n\nPan-Frying\n\nWhen used properly, a stainless steel skillet is the best pan-frying surface, period. It\u2019s nonstick enough for perfect softly-scrambled eggs, yet sticky enough to facilitate the all-important Maillard reaction. The secret is to preheat your pan at the desired heat for a few minutes before adding the fat, then heat the fat in the hot pan for an additional minute or two. (This works at any temperature.) When you\u2019ve got a hot stainless steel skillet coated with hot fat, nothing will stick to it\u2014not even fried cheese.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2ydUPlM\n\nWhen I first started cooking for myself and others, I considered a steak dinner to be the epitome\u2026\n\nRead more\n\nBoiling and Steaming\n\nA good stock pot is a true kitchen workhorse. Whether you\u2019re boiling three pounds of pasta, simmering a gallon of Sunday gravy, or steaming up some artichokes, a stainless stock pot will get the job done right.\n\nBraising\n\nI already talked a little bit about how much I love using a big stainless saut\u00e9 pan for slow-roasted stews, but a covered stainless pan is also excellent for quick stovetop braises. The lids I waxed poetic about earlier are the true stars here: they make braising super-easy.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2xjkJoU\n\nBraising or pot roasting is a great technique for making meat more tender. If you braise the meat\u2026\n\nRead more\n\nIt Costs Whatever You Can Afford\n\nHigh-quality stainless steel can be found in every price range. The only kind you want is \u201cclad\u201d or \u201cmulti-ply,\u201d which means it\u2019s made from multiple layers of metal. Super-fancy clad stainless uses a copper core for heat conduction; less-expensive models generally use an aluminum core. As long as you look for heavy-bottomed, multi-ply, all-stainless construction, you can\u2019t go wrong. Here are some recommendations to get you started.\n\nBourgie\n\nIf price is no object, All-Clad is the gold standard of stainless cookware. A ten-piece copper-core set costs about $1300; a fourteen-piece set is just under $2000. Believe it or not, you can spend even more if you want\u2014check out Alessi pans for some real cookware porn\u2014but I don\u2019t condone spending thousands of dollars on cookware. Buy a reasonably-priced used car or contribute to your IRA instead, for Pete\u2019s (or your own) sake.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2cwC2qQ\n\nDespite their high price tags, All-Clad Tri-Ply skillets are among the most popular pieces of\u2026\n\nRead more\n\nMedium-Bourgie\n\nBoth Williams Sonoma and Sur La Table make excellent cookware under their house brands, and Calphalon and Anolon both offer very good multi-ply stainless sets. Steer clear of the reasonably priced \u201cClassic Stainless\u201d sets you find in department stores, though: they lack the multi-ply construction and heft that makes a great pan.\n\nBudget\n\nShould the dystopian hellscape that is late-stage capitalism provide you no options outside of ethically-questionable Chinese knockoffs, I highly recommend a Cook\u2019s Standard set. I\u2019ve used mine daily for five years and it shows zero wear and tear. It was also less than two hundred dollars, but I have no plans to upgrade.\n\nhttp://ift.tt/2xiFYHs\n\nDear Lifehacker, I've had the same pots and pans for years. Some of it's starting to look \u2026\n\nRead more\n\nVery Tight Budget\n\nIf you know what to look for, Goodwill and other thrift stores can be treasure troves. My best tip for cookware thrifting is to Google makes and models on your phone right there in the store before buying. You probably won\u2019t find a full matching set, and you\u2019ll absolutely have to rifle through piles of terrible thin-bottomed pots, but you also might find a really nice Calphalon pan for five bucks.\n\nWhen it comes to versatility, durability, and functionality, stainless steel is truly unmatched. If you\u2019ve ever passed on stainless in favor of other cookware, I hope this inspires you to take a second look. You won\u2019t regret it.\n",
