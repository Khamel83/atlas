      "Selection": "With a new chief of staff, Trump's refocusing on his top priority: making America afraid again.\n \nAs a businessman, Donald Trump didn\u2019t really get rich because he was good at making deals. He got rich because he was good at branding himself.\n\nSo it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that after a rocky first six months in office, he\u2019s jettisoning Reince Priebus, the chief of staff he initially accepted as the condition of a deal \u2014 his pact with the Republican Party, after winning the presidency, to work with the establishment rather than against it \u2014 and replacing him with a retired general who\u2019s currently carrying out Trump\u2019s immigration agenda.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who Trump announced in a Friday tweet would be his new chief of staff, is perfectly in line with the brand that first brought Trump to campaign success: the idea that the world is a terrifying place full of people (mostly foreigners) who want to undermine social order and the American way of life, and that the tough American men who stand up to them shouldn\u2019t be too closely questioned about how they keep those threats at bay.\n\nThat brand has succeeded for Trump \u2014 it\u2019s made the right people happy (his base and the cable news networks that generate endless debate over inflammatory remarks), it\u2019s made the right people angry (Democrats and people who go on cable news networks), and if it\u2019s terrified certain groups, they\u2019ve been people who don\u2019t seem to matter to Trump (immigrants and black Americans who vote for Democrats). \n\nThe appointment of Kelly \u2014 along with a speech Trump gave in Long Island on Friday afternoon that harkened back to the most chilling rhetoric of his campaign \u2014 is a sign that the Trump administration is rededicating itself to placing those ideas front and center. And it\u2019s rhetoric that, even beyond the policy agenda it represents, invites violence into the crevices of American life. \n\nKelly represents Trumpism as its most authentic\n\nReince Priebus was doomed from the beginning. He was hired as the White House\u2019s resident Republican insider \u2014 which is to say, from the perspective of Trumpworld, its resident outsider.\n\nPriebus\u2019s notion of the White House was alien to Trump\u2019s \u2014 he had quaint ideas about managing Trump\u2019s time and working with factions of Congress to pass bills. But just as importantly, when he did the things Trump expected his top staffers to do \u2014 namely, go on television and defend the president\u2019s agenda \u2014 he wasn\u2019t a credible messenger. It was too obvious that he was the kind of person who thought that life had been basically okay before 2017, that Washington hadn\u2019t abandoned Americans to the rampages of criminal gangs. \n\nTechnically, Priebus was fired after the project he\u2019d been assigned \u2014 getting Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2014 failed in the Senate. But really, he was fired because, whether he succeeded or not, he didn\u2019t perform in a way Trump understood or respected.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s health care agenda has foundered \u2014 as has much of the rest of his platform \u2014 his immigration agenda has not. As he promised, federal immigration agents are \u201cunshackled.\u201d As he promised, immigrants are being treated more harshly upon being apprehended at the border. The wall is happening slowly (and really, everyone involved agrees it\u2019s more of a fence) but it\u2019s moving along.\n\nBut while it\u2019s true that Trump is simply elevating the man who\u2019s overseen the administration\u2019s biggest substantive success so far \u2014 Kelly \u2014 the reality is substantially more complicated.\n\nKelly wasn\u2019t the brains behind the Trump immigration agenda. Most of it was designed by then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (before he became Attorney General and got shut out of Trump\u2019s inner circle) and former Sessions staffers now highly placed in the White House, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security.\n\nBut over the course of Kelly\u2019s six months at the head of DHS, he became the face of the Trump immigration agenda. And to Trump, that\u2019s even more important.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that Kelly looked the part, or that his appearances on Sunday shows gave off the air of an upstanding military man who was a little uncomfortable doing a media appearance when there were wars to be fought. It\u2019s the fact that Kelly spoke \u2014 and to all appearances believed \u2014 as if the Trump administration was a constant war against the forces of lawlessness and disorder. \n\nTo Chuck Todd, he called intelligence leaks \u201cdarn close to treason.\u201d He warned Martha Raddatz that \u201cyou just have to be vigilant\u201d about terrorism because \u201cthis is nonstop. They are out there trying to hurt us every day.\u201d He told John Dickerson that he was kept awake at night and distracted four to five times a day by the threat of a terrorist attack \u201cto knock down an airplane in flight.\u201d \n\nTo Chris Wallace of Fox News, he justified the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban by saying, \u201cWe have to figure out a way to determine who they are and why they come into the United States. Otherwise, we\u2019re guessing. And this president and John Kelly doesn't want to guess when it comes to national security and protection of the US population.\u201d\n\nTrump, easily distracted, hadn\u2019t often returned as president to the apocalyptic rhetoric of an America under siege that he used at the most important moments on the campaign trail. Kelly did.\n\nIn a speech at George Washington University in May \u2014 a mission statement about Kelly\u2019s priorities as secretary, delivered to an audience of Washington elites \u2014 Kelly was shockingly martial. \u201cMake no mistake \u2014 we are a nation under attack. We are under attack from criminals who think their greed justifies raping young girls at knifepoint, dealing poison to our youth, or killing just for fun.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the Kelly that many had expected when he was nominated \u2014 the regional Latin America expert who hated politics and would think a wall was total bunk. It sounded, well, a lot like Donald Trump, at a time when Trump wasn\u2019t spending much time sounding like his old self.\n\nNow, though, that passage from Kelly\u2019s speech might sound familiar. It\u2019s awfully close to the rhetoric Trump used on Friday, during a speech in Long Island that was ostensibly about MS-13 but really about how important it was for ICE to be rough on immigrant \u201ccriminals.\u201d \n\nThe Long Island speech came on the heels of Trump\u2019s defeat on health care in the Senate. It wasn\u2019t the first time his administration had pivoted back to immigration in an attempt to move on from an embarrassing setback on something else. But it was notable in its total lack of restraint \u2014 its insistence on turning subtext into text. President Trump (and even, for the most part, candidate Trump during the general election) hadn\u2019t explicitly endorsed physical violence. On Friday, he called on police officers to shove suspects into cars without protecting the suspects\u2019 heads from the impact. \n\nIt was, at once, absolutely bone-chilling and inevitable. It was a return to form. But it was a return to a form that many hoped Trump would have retired, for good, once assuming office.\n\nTrumpism isn\u2019t just an ideology, but the belief that talking about something makes it so\n\nTrump may like the idea of having \u201ca general\u201d in charge of his White House staff, but Trump isn\u2019t handing the reins to Kelly any more than he handed them to Priebus. The loosest cannon in the administration, newly hired White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, will report directly to Trump, not to the chief of staff.\n\nManaging isn\u2019t how Trump believes things get done. He believes things get done by talking about them. Now that he\u2019s president, his rhetoric of America under siege has a counterpart: that under Trump, as he said on Friday, America is being \u201cliberated.\u201d\n\nTo a certain extent, this requires exaggerating his accomplishments, ignoring his setbacks. Sometimes it means that an extremely moderate policy is treated as a huge repudiation of progressivism or Obama; the administration has happily trumpeted a few dozen miles of border fencing in a House bill as \u201cmoney for the wall.\u201d When that happens, Trumpism\u2019s bark really is worse than its bite.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. Trump isn\u2019t entirely wrong that using the bully pulpit to broadcast his worldview makes it real. It creates a space for other people to enact Trumpism on Trump\u2019s behalf, outside the diktats of policy \u2014 either for people to use it as an excuse for violence against others, or as something to avoid by changing their own behavior.\n\nIt is true that if you tell immigration officers that the handcuffs are off, and then let them do what they want, they\u2019ll be more assertive and aggressive. It\u2019s true that if you tell police officers that protesters are a threat to social order and you don\u2019t care whether people get beaten up while being loaded into cars, some of those police officers will rough people up while loading them into cars.\n\nIt\u2019s true that you can, at least temporarily, deter people from coming to the United States without papers if you make it clear they\u2019ll be put in prison even if they seek asylum, or that parents might be tracked down and deported for sending for their children to join them. It\u2019s true that you can stop people from asking for food stamps or taking their children to school if they\u2019re afraid of deportation \u2014 or if they\u2019re afraid of violence at the hands of your supporters.\n\nJohn Kelly is very good at telling people to be afraid \u2014 either of the government, or of the people the government is fighting. That\u2019s not just Trump\u2019s brand. It\u2019s his theory of governance.",
