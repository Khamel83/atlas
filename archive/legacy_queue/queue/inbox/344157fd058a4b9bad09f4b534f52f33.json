      "Selection": "And here\u2019s what comes next.\n\nIn the introduction to his 1987 Cultural Literacy, E.D. Hirsch Jr. laments the loss of a shared American culture \u2014 a body of knowledge, from Shakespeare to the Bible, that united Americans.\n\nHe recalls his father\u2019s propensity for quoting a particular truncated line from Shakespeare\u2019s Julius Caesar whenever encouraging his colleagues to act swiftly: \u201cthere is a tide [in the affairs of men / which taken at the flood leads to fortune].\u201d His colleagues \u2014 educated men themselves, Hirsch implies \u2014 would understand the reference, and so cultural communication would function smoothly. This shared consciousness, he suggested 20 years ago, was on its way out.\n\nHirsch\u2019s nostalgia may seem even more dated now than it did in 1987. The idea of a \u201ccanon\u201d of a shared cultural shorthand has been challenged as outmoded and exclusionary, unfitting for a pluralist society. Likewise, among the \u201cneoreactionaries\u201d of the alt-right in particular, the shared shorthand of (white, Judeo-Christian) cultural literacy is symbolic of a disappearing, homogenous \u201cWest\u201d to which we can and must return.\n\nThree decades later, in the fascinating, complex 2016 book The End of White Christian America, the Public Religion Research Institute\u2019s founder and CEO Robert Jones traces the decline not merely of a demographic, but of the racial and religious contours of that very culture. Jones described the decline of \"a shared aesthetic, a historical framework, and a moral vocabulary \u2026 [a] lingua franca.\u201d\n\nThough the book begins and ends with a mock eulogy for white Christian America (WCA), it\u2019s not quite a eulogy, nor is it gleeful grave stomping. Rather, it is a sensitive, nuanced look at the decline of a world \"where few gave a second thought to saying \u2018Merry Christmas!\u2019 to strangers on the street ... a world of shared rhythms that punctuated the week: Wednesday spaghetti suppers and prayer meetings, invocations from local pastors under the Friday night lights at high school football games, and Sunday blue laws that shuttered Main Street for the Sabbath.\u201d\n\nThe loss of these traditions reflects WCA\u2019s demographic decline through the rise of a more ethnically and religiously diverse America. But it also indicates that we\u2019ve lost a wider \u201cshared\u201d (if not universally) sense of cultural understanding in the public sphere: both on the smaller scale of the town hall on and on the large scale of the White House.\n\nJones traces WCA\u2019s decline as a culturally powerful institution, however, not just as the result of demographic change but rather as the result of white Protestant churches failing to adapt to a multicultural, multiracial America. Jones casts his eye on a complacent mainline Protestant church that failed to hold on to the fervor of its members, and an evangelical church that sailed to the \u201cmoral majority\u201d on issues of segregation and race.\n\nPRRI itself is known for its careful cultural analysis of everything from the United Methodist Building in Washington, DC, once a de facto monument to the mainline cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of Prohibition, to Macklemore\u2019s celebration of \u201csame love\u201d at the Grammy Awards. Blending the kind of exhaustive data PRRI touts, Jones traces two intertwined cultural histories: that of mainline Protestantism \u2014 careful, ecumenical, less fervent in the culture wars \u2014 and its sometime rival evangelical Protestantism, whose fervent and uncompromising reactionary approach to hot-button political issues from segregation to LGBTQ issues was responsible for both its rise and, he says, its downfall.\n\nJones traces the history not just of evangelicals but also of mainline Protestantism\n\nAs Jones tells it, while mainline Protestants took a careful, interfaith approach to social issues, quietly emphasizing social justice on an institutional level, evangelical groups edged their way into public prominence by a more conservative approach to doctrine, a focus on salvation, and a patriotic Christianity deeply indebted to the idea that the United States should be an \u201cexplicitly Christian nation.\u201d\n\nMainline Protestantism declined first, as it lost ground to secularism and to the evangelical right, which was quicker to raise the political pulse. But as the culture wars of the \u201980s and \u201990s gave way to certain permanent shifts in American culture \u2014 most religious Americans now support same-sex marriage, and among young evangelicals support is likewise increasing \u2014 evangelicals found themselves, too, at sea.\n\nBooks, articles, and think pieces about the \u201creligious right\u201d are thick on the ground. Yet Jones\u2019s nuanced take is most fascinating when it deals not with the flashier evangelicals and their celebrity-studded megachurches, but with their narratively drabber cousins. Mainline Protestants, regardless of political affiliation, tend to fade into the background in discussions of religion in America. Still, Jones highlights their importance, not just in their own right \u2014 from the history of abolition to the temperance movement \u2014 but as a perpetual foil to evangelicals.\n\nIt would be easy for Jones to set up a neat dichotomy in which mainline Protestants are the \u201cgood guys\u201d \u2014 focusing on social justice and inclusion even as their brethren in the South supported segregation. And it\u2019s certainly true that he is unsparing when it comes to evangelicals\u2019 uneasy historical alliance with racism. He reminds us that \u201carticles in the leading evangelical magazine Christianity Today encouraged Christians to root out racism in their own lives, but also criticized integration. Separating people of different races through law was not portrayed as a moral evil \u2014 in fact, some argued that it was necessary to maintain peace in the South. One author declared that supporters of integration were espousing a kind of \u2018Christian communism.\u2019\u201d (Christianity Today\u2019s mainline counterpart, the Christian Century, meanwhile, named Martin Luther King Jr. an editor at large.)\n\nFor Jones, we are living in the twilight days of what was once known as white Christian America\n\nBut Jones recognizes, too, that mainline Protestantism largely squandered its enormous political, social, and financial advantage over its evangelical cousins to the South, inadvertently ceding its status as the mouthpiece of American Christendom. After all, he says, mainline Protestantism\u2019s contributions to civil rights \"were ultimately more symbolic than revolutionary, and more focused on the press than grounded in the pews.\"\n\nOverall, the age gap reflects this disparity: According to PRRI\u2019s research, almost seven in 10 seniors identify as white Christians, versus fewer than three in 10 young adults. The recent decline in (white) mainline numbers in particular is striking: from 24 percent of the population in 1988 to just 14 percent in 2012.\n\nJones\u2019s interest in WCA is cultural, rather than theological, and at its most incisive when he\u2019s chronicling the death of a certain identity: one far more tied into whiteness and the rote wishing of a \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d than any particular theological stance. (If anything, this is the book\u2019s one weakness. Other than a brief mention of Walter Rauschenbusch's \u201csocial gospel,\u201d very little of Jones\u2019s approach to WCA investigates how differences in actual theology or the structure of worship services might reflect, or tie into, the cultural differences that separate mainline Protestants from evangelicals, and from everybody else.)\n\nHe\u2019s incisive, too, when describing the cultural segregation still at play in America \u2014 quoting a PRRI survey that the core social networks of white Americans are 91 percent white and only 1 percent black. He\u2019s likewise dubious about the possibility for remedying this, pointing out that \"America has virtually no large-scale, widely distributed civic institutions that are equipped to nurture strong relationships across racial divides.\u201d\n\nIn such a paradigm, it\u2019s easy to understand how, say, white evangelical Protestants can at once perceive themselves to be under attack and possess such strong institutional power within their own communities: both things, in a fragmented America, are possible. Jones even elicits sympathy for those evangelical Christians who, witnessing their gradual media irrelevance over culture-war battlegrounds like LGBTQ issues, do find themselves, like Hirsch, at a cultural sea, unable to navigate a society whose new shibboleths they do not know.\n\nYet Jones raises the possibility that Christianity can only function effectively as a religion in the absence of its dominance in culture, which is to say, as the underdog. Just as Southern evangelicals came to dominance as a response to the perceived diminishing of Christianity in the public sphere among the pluralistic tendencies of the 1950s, so too, Jones suggests, must any effective Christianity of today \u2014 one capable of firing up its members \u2014 respond against the dominant culture.\n\nHe cites several recent examples of thinkers who have advocated just that, from Rod Dreher\u2019s \u201cBenedict option\u201d of focused seclusion to Baptist firebrand Russell Moore\u2019s embrace of Christianity as counter-\u201ccultural.\u201d He writes, \"As Christianity seems increasingly strange, and even subversive, to our culture, we have the opportunity to reclaim the freakishness of the gospel, which is what gives it its power in the first place.\u201d\n\nIt is that paradox that lies at the heart of The End of White Christian America, and in discussions of Christianity and public life more generally. How can a religion often defined as a religion of outsiders \u2014 one whose sacred texts embrace the overturning of the money changers in the Jerusalem temple and celebrate those who leave their families behind to follow a wandering preacher \u2014 ever function in a dominant paradigm without losing its distinctive character?\n\nIt is that question that Jones\u2019s book leaves us wondering: whether the death of White Christian America, as a cultural construct, is a good thing for Christianity, the religion. For a religion that was once subversive, Jones hints, being countercultural may just be the ideal way to be.",
