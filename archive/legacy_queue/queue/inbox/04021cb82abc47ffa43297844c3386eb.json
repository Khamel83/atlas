      "Selection": "I Believe I Can Fly: The Oral History of \u2018Space\u00a0Jam\u2019\n\nWell, not\u00a0really\n\n\u201cThanks, guys. You got a lot of\u00a0\u2026 a lot of\u00a0\u2026 well, whatever it is, you got a lot of it.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aMichael Jordan, Space Jam\n\nSpace Jam, which turns 20 years old this November, is about a collection of famous cartoon characters who find themselves at the precipice of being enslaved by the monsters inhabiting an alien planet. Bugs Bunny, the de facto leader of the Looney Tunes, arranges a basketball game against their would-be captors. If the Tunes win, the aliens return home empty-handed. If the Tunes lose, they become the property of Mr. Swackhammer, an egg-shaped villain who runs a fledgling theme park on a distant planet. (The Tunes will work in his theme park as new attractions.)\n\nTo tilt the game in their favor, the aliens steal the talent of several superstar NBA players (and Shawn Bradley). In response, Bugs arranges for Michael Jordan to join the Tunes\u2019 team. It\u2019s a ridiculous movie and also a perfect movie that has done more than just survive the test of time; it has endured it, and even been strengthened by it. Larry Bird is in it. Jim Rome is in it. An alien shows his dick to a stadium full of people. A cat gets a hole shot through his chest. There\u2019s a lot going on. But how did it all happen? How did this movie get made? And almost not get made?\n\nThis is the oral history of Space Jam.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: This is a completely satirical exercise and does not reflect the views of the filmmakers, actors, athletes, and cartoon characters depicted herein.]\n\nChapter I.\u201cGet Bugs. If we get Bugs, the rest will\u00a0follow.\u201d\n\nEnsemble movies pose a unique challenge. Getting several marquee names to work on a project together is no small task. Fortunately, Joe Pytka, who directed Space Jam, and Ivan Reitman, one of the film\u2019s producers, had someone on their side with a little bit of experience in just that sort of thing.\n\nJoe Pytka: I really had no idea how to even start signing people up. You\u2019ve got this script and you see that you need over 15 of the most famous cartoon characters of all time to make it work and it\u2019s just a really overwhelming situation. And were that not enough, you also have to figure out a way to sign up several of the most famous NBA players, too. It was very overwhelming.\n\nAllow the Ringer (Fictional) Playbook to explain how that big backdoor cut from \u2018White Men Can\u2019t Jump\u2019 happened.\nIvan Reitman: So you\u2019re like, \u201cHow do I do this? Where do I start? What\u2019s the game plan?\u201d I was really stressed out about it. The movie doesn\u2019t work without all the right pieces. You can\u2019t just jumble any ol\u2019 things together and expect it to work. You think Ocean\u2019s Eleven works without Brad Pitt or George Clooney or Matt Damon or Don Cheadle and on and on? Each one of those pieces was vital, even the nerdy tech guy. If any one of those people doesn\u2019t get signed up, the movie just doesn\u2019t work. Imagine Ocean\u2019s Eleven with Hugh Jackman instead of Clooney. It\u2019s a different movie.\n\nPytka: We had our list. We knew we wanted Bugs, Daffy, Porky, etc. We knew we wanted Charles Barkley, Larry Johnson, Muggsy Bogues, etc. In total, it was like 25 or so roles we were trying to fill. That\u2019s a lot of fucking roles. And each one has to be perfect? Come on. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t know how to do it. Thank god for Michael.\n\nMichael Jordan: I\u2019d been through a similar situation with the Dream Team back in \u201992. You\u2019re trying to gather together all of these very talented individuals who have a bunch of other things they\u2019d rather do, so you need a starting point. I told Pytka, \u201cGet Bugs. If we get Bugs, the rest will follow.\u201d So that\u2019s what they did.\n\nBugs Bunny: I\u2019d heard about the movie. I\u2019d talked to my agent about it. They were looking at a few different people for it. Denzel [Washington] was auditioning for Danny DeVito\u2019s part originally. [DeVito voiced Mr. Swackhammer.] That\u2019s what I\u2019d heard, anyway. I was really excited about working with him. I loved him in Malcolm X. So when I heard that he was gonna be a part of Space Jam, I knew I wanted to be involved. I told my agent, \u201cGet me on this movie.\u201d\n\nReitman: That\u2019s a trick I\u2019d learned a long time ago. Any time I had a movie, I\u2019d tell the director to float it out there that we were having Denzel audition. Everyone looks up to Denzel. Even early in his career it was like that. He just has this presence. \u201cOh shit, Denzel might be in it? Let me get signed on before I miss out.\u201d That\u2019s how I got Stallone to do Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot in 1992. We told his agent that Denzel was auditioning for the part of Stallone\u2019s dad. Originally it was called Stop! Or My Dad Will Shoot. After we got Stallone signed on, we changed it to Mom. He was pretty pissed. But what are you gonna do? That\u2019s show business.\n\nPytka: So we floated that out there and let it sit for a while. Then we made the call. Bugs jumped right in. It was great. And Mike was right. After we had Bugs attached to it, everyone else fell in line. Daffy, Porky, Foghorn Leghorn, Marvin the Martian, the Tasmanian Devil, Wile E. Coyote, the grandma, Tweety. We were just signing up name after name after name. It was so exciting. Early on, it felt clear that we were gonna do something special.\n\nJordan: The NBA players were easy. They told me who they wanted\u200a\u2014\u200ait was Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Muggsy, LJ, and a few cameos by some others. I said, \u201cHey, guys. Let\u2019s get Shawn Bradley.\u201d I thought it\u2019d be funny. I didn\u2019t think they were really gonna do it! I was just joking around. Next thing I know, here comes Bradley walking onto the lot. Have you ever seen Shawn Bradley in regular clothes? It\u2019s the funniest shit you ever saw. It looks like when you hang clothes on a hanger.\n\nTasmanian Devil: We gave Shawn so much shit, man. Every day he was on the set it was like a straight-up Shawn Bradley roast. The best one was one day Daffy told Shawn that he looked like if Shaquille O\u2019Neal\u2019s skeleton had escaped from his body and was running free. I laughed so fucking hard at that one. Poor Shawn. He was a good sport about it, though. He took it all in stride.\n\nShawn Bradley: Taz is rude.\n\nChapter II.\u201cI mean, if you sat me down me down like, \u2018Foghorn, one of the Toons in here is speciesist. Guess who.\u2019 I never would\u2019ve guessed\u00a0Porky.\u201d\n\nWith the cast set, the producers were excited to get everybody together for a table read. What happened was far more intense than anyone had anticipated, and nearly derailed Space Jam before a single scene had even been shot.\n\nFoghorn Leghorn: We\u2019re reading through the scripts, right? We\u2019re on the Warner Bros. lot in some room. Everyone\u2019s sitting around a big table. It\u2019s just regular stuff. There\u2019s sandwiches. It\u2019s a great time. Anyway, we\u2019re all there and we\u2019re all very excited and we\u2019re going over lines from the scene right after halftime, where the Toons come out all fired up and start scoring a bunch of points. It\u2019s a fun part.\n\nSo we\u2019re saying the lines and there\u2019s one little quick line where Sylvester has to say\u00a0\u2026\n\nSylvester the Cat: \u201cGoing up.\u201d That\u2019s the line. I\u2019ll never forget it. It\u2019s two words in a scene that\u2019s, like, two seconds total, but I\u2019ll never forget it.\n\nFoghorn: Me neither.\n\nMarvin the Martian: Whenever I land one of these types of ensemble jobs, I\u2019m always curious to see how everyone\u2019s going to get along when you first get together and start going through things. I\u2019ve been on sets where things were smooth and great and everybody got along perfect. I\u2019ve been on others where you knew real quick that things were gonna be a fucking disaster. It was clear pretty quickly that some of the people on Space Jam weren\u2019t going to get along.\n\nSylvester: In the scene, we were supposed to form a three-person ladder lifting me up to dunk the ball. It was supposed to be Foghorn at the bottom, then Porky in the middle, then me at the top. We all stack up and then as I\u2019m on my way up to dunk I say, \u201cGoing up.\u201d Well, if you watch the scene closely, you see that it\u2019s Porky who ended up at the top. You can also see how frustrated I look about it.\n\nWarner Bros.\nFoghorn: We were positioned originally by size. I mean, look at us. Sly\u2019s a little guy, I\u2019m a big guy. Porky, sizewise, he\u2019s the middle point, so it made sense that the director would have him in the middle. But so we get to that part and Porky\u200a\u2014\u200aoutta nowhere\u200a\u2014\u200ahe just fucking loses it. He explodes. \u201cWhy do I have to be in the middle? I\u2019m Porky fucking Pig!\u201d Things like that. And at first I thought, OK, I mean, he\u2019s got a point. He is Porky Pig. I thought he was making a fuss because he\u2019s this big star. And that makes sense. You expect that. The guy had been in the business for 60 years by that point. It\u2019d be silly for me to expect him to not have an ego. But it wasn\u2019t that. It wasn\u2019t that at all.\n\n[Porky Pig declined to participate in this story.]\n\nPepe Le Pew: It was ugly.\n\nFoghorn: I say, I say, \u201cPorks, baby, we ain\u2019t stacking up by star power. Everyone knows you\u2019re the man. Everyone knows you\u2019re the top dude. This is just a size thing. I\u2019m big, you\u2019re medium, Sly\u2019s small. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d I\u2019m trying to explain the situation to him, right? And, again, I thought this was just one of those dick-measuring contests. But it wasn\u2019t.\n\nMarvin: The thing you have to remember about Porky is he\u2019s an old-school dude. He started working back in the 1930s. Things were\u00a0\u2026 different back then.\n\nSylvester: He starts shouting all of this stuff about\u00a0\u2026 look, I don\u2019t want to say the exact things he was saying, but I will say that it was some real intolerant stuff.\n\nFoghorn: Fuck that. I\u2019ll say it. I don\u2019t care. He\u2019s shouting about how he\u2019s not letting some cat sit on his shoulders, that it\u2019s pigs who sit on the shoulders of cats, not cats who sit on the shoulders of pigs. \u201cI\u2019m not propping up that cat! That cat props me up!\u201d Things like that. And he\u2019s literally pointing his finger right at Sly while he\u2019s saying it, too. It was just an ugly, ugly scene. And we\u2019re all sitting there like, \u201cOh my god.\u201d\n\nPepe: We were stunned. All of us. It\u2019s literally our first day together and you\u2019re like, \u201cHold on. Porky Pig is speciesist?!\u201d Speciesism is a big issue. I\u2019m looking around the room and we got birds, we got bunnies. We got a coyote, we got a Tasmanian devil, we got a duck. I\u2019m a skunk! It\u2019s like, \u201cWho else does he feel this way about?\u201d There was a town hall scene later in the movie and they had me sit next to Porky, and it was real uncomfortable. Porky made a big fuss there about how he had to be in the first row with his hillbilly homies and also how he wouldn\u2019t sit on the same side of the room as Sylvester.\n\nWarner Bros.\nFoghorn: Oh shit, that\u2019s right. I\u2019d forgotten about the town hall scene. Porky was legit advocating for segregation in that scene. He said I could sit on his side because I \u201chad an accent [he] could trust\u201d because I\u2019m from the South.\n\nPatrick Ewing: I knew real fast that I didn\u2019t want to be too involved with Hollywood after what I saw that day.\n\nMarvin: Nobody expected that kind of behavior on set. At least not from Porky, anyway.\n\nFoghorn: I mean, if you sat me down me down like, \u201cFoghorn, one of the Toons in here is speciesist. Guess who.\u201d I never would\u2019ve guessed Porky.\n\nSylvester [to Foghorn]: Who would you have guessed?\n\nFoghorn: Oh, Elmer Fudd, easy. It\u2019s not even a question.\n\n[Everyone laughs.]\n\nSylvester: Porky just wouldn\u2019t let it go. \u201cYou can kiss my pig ass if you think I\u2019m propping up that cat, or any cat!\u201d I mean, he\u2019s at full volume. And it\u2019s super testy. Nobody knows what to do.\n\nFoghorn: Sylvester is a better person than me.\n\nSylvester: I just wanted it to be over. I\u2019m like, \u201cLook, it\u2019s not that big of a deal. Porky can be on the top. Just let him do it. It\u2019s fine.\u201d And Porky\u2019s like, \u201cLet me? LET me? Listen here, you cat bastard\u00a0\u2026 \u201d And the director\u2019s trying to calm him down. Honestly, I felt like socking him right in his pig nose. But what\u2019s that gonna solve? Then he gets to go home and tell his pig family that he was attacked by a cat? No, I\u2019m not playing into that. So I just let it go.\n\nMarvin: Nobody really talked to Porky too much after that.\n\nChapter III.\u201cCartoon cocaine is just as addictive as real cocaine.\u201d\n\nEveryone was curious to see how the humans and the cartoon characters would interact with one another. Thankfully, aside from Porky, everything went smoother than anyone had hoped. At least until Elmer and Jordan clashed.\n\nCharles Barkley: Those guys are so much fun, man. Listen, let me tell you something: Those guys can party, whoa boy. I\u2019ll never forget one of the times I was there, I heard this noise coming from the back of one of the rooms. I kept hearing it, over and over again. I walk back there and it\u2019s Tweety and Sylvester. Did you know they get along in real life? Because they do. They\u2019re good friends.\n\nBut so I hear the noise and I go back there and I see them, and Tweety has this $100 bill rolled up and I couldn\u2019t believe it. He was snorting cartoon cocaine off a little tiny cartoon mirror while Sylvester played cartoon Sega Genesis. I said, \u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d Tweety looked up, and looked me right in the eye. He said, \u201cChuck, listen when I tell you this: Cartoon cocaine is just as addictive as real cocaine.\u201d That little bird was cool as shit. I still don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a boy bird or a girl bird, though. I saw Tweety do stuff on set that made me think he was a guy, but also stuff that made me think she was a girl. I don\u2019t know. Doesn\u2019t matter. Great hang, either way.\n\nMuggsy Bogues: I really enjoyed my time on set. There were a few people I really connected with. Lola Bunny and I had a real great connection.\n\nLola Bunny: Muggsy kept hanging around my trailer. It was sweet until it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve been dealing with that my whole career.\n\nWarner Bros.\nPepe: People ask me all the time, \u201cWhat\u2019s the most memorable thing about having worked on Space Jam?\u201d And the answer is never what they think it\u2019s going to be, because the answer is: seeing an alien\u2019s dick. During the second half of our game against the Monstars, one of them\u200a\u2014\u200athe big Charles Barkley one\u200a\u2014\u200aended up naked from the waist down after Sylvester used a fishing pole to snatch his shorts off of him. I thought we were just gonna green-screen that part, because that\u2019s what we did for most of the movie. But the director was like, \u201cNo. This has to be real. We have to make this as real as possible.\u201d So that part really happened. That poor dude really had to show his dick to a stadium full of people. So of course that\u2019s the most memorable thing. I\u2019d seen Jordan a million times on TV. I\u2019d never seen an alien dick, though.\n\nWayne Knight: One of the most exciting days was when all the Looney Tunes got to meet up with Michael. A lot of people were expecting Michael to be a jerk. That\u2019s just the reputation that he had. But he was really great. He\u2019s very charming, very outgoing. He made everyone feel real comfortable, he put everyone at ease. Well, almost everyone.\n\nReitman: The only real trouble anyone had with Jordan was one day he and Elmer Fudd got into it real bad over a bet that Mike wouldn\u2019t pay on.\n\nElmer Fudd: I\u2019d rather not talk about that.\n\nJordan: We were playing guts. You know guts? It\u2019s a card game. You\u2019re basically just trying to make the best three-card hand you can. Anyway, he gets into me for $10-$15K, something like that. And he\u2019s really laying into me about it. Like, it ain\u2019t just normal trash talk. I understand normal trash talk. That\u2019s totally fine. And it started out that way. \u201cOoh, I\u2019ma take that Nike money\u201d; \u201cI got some new Jordan Rules for you, Mike. Rule 1: fuck you.\u201d Things like that. Which, again, those are fine. But then it turned venomous. He was saying things about my family. Truly hurtful things. Things where, like, if you\u2019re in a room and you\u2019re watching two guys go at it and one guy says something like this to the other guy then everyone in the room just sort of goes quiet.\n\nBill Murray: Of course I remember that day. Elmer was saying some nasty stuff to MJ. The worst of it was after MJ had lost again and he was down maybe $8,000 by that point. Now, Michael Jordan\u2019s one of the richest people in the country. $8,000 is nothing to him. But Elmer uses the opportunity to take a real cheap shot at MJ. Michael loses, then Elmer says [REDACTED FOR DECENCY].\n\nLarry Bird: I couldn\u2019t believe he said it! Michael was near tears. So was I, to be perfectly honest.\n\nLola: My jaw hit the floor. Literally. I\u2019m a cartoon, so it can do that.\n\nJordan: You know when something\u2019s gone too far. He was going too far. So he\u2019s yelling these things at me, and I tell him, \u201cLook, you gotta tone it down.\u201d And he just kept going. So when it was time to pay him I just told him to fuck off. He\u2019s 3 feet tall, you know what I\u2019m saying? What\u2019s he gonna do? I still don\u2019t understand why he was so mad.\n\nBugs: Oh, I know exactly why Elmer was mad. All the Looney Tunes did. Did you know that Space Jam actually started as a commercial? Michael and I shot it to run during the Super Bowl one year and his agent took it and used it as a way to do the movie. But so during the commercial, there\u2019s a part where I have to play some guys in basketball. Michael shows up and he\u2019s my partner. When he shows up, the guys I was supposed to play all gasp. And MJ says something like, \u201cWho were you expecting? Elmer Fudd?\u201d Elmer didn\u2019t appreciate that. That\u2019s why he was so mad at Mike. Stuff like that, he never lets it go. He\u2019s a real hot head. I mean, he\u2019s been trying to shoot me for decades.\n\nReitman: Minus the Elmer-Jordan thing, filming went pretty smoothly. It was a 95 percent great experience.\n\nChapter IV.\u201cThat\u2019s all,\u00a0folks.\u201d\n\nWith filming wrapped and approaching release, the cast and crew went their separate ways. Little did they know that Space Jam would go on to become the highest-grossing basketball movie of all time and an undeniable part of the canon.\n\nBugs: You know, you work and you work and you work on a thing and you don\u2019t really know what it\u2019s gonna do. You hope it\u2019ll do well, but you can never really say for sure.\n\nPytka: We were all scared. Nobody knew what to think when it was coming out.\n\nFoghorn: The thing I remember the most about the movie being over is that Michael kept trying to tell everyone that the last play of the game\u200a\u2014\u200athat stretch dunk thing he does\u200a\u2014\u200ahe kept trying to tell everyone that he\u2019d really done that. He swore up and down that it wasn\u2019t special effects. I said, \u201cMichael, you really expect me to believe that you stretched your arm 40 feet long and dunked it from half court? You for real expect me to believe that?\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re a giant cartoon chicken and you speak English.\u201d I guess he had a point.\n\nSylvester: I loved working on Space Jam. It remains the only movie I\u2019ve ever done. A lot of people think it\u2019s because of the Porky Pig thing. It\u2019s not. I really loved working on Space Jam. If they actually end up doing part two, I hope they call me.\n\nTweety: I can\u2019t say that I don\u2019t wish I had more lines in it, but I also can\u2019t say that watching it age into folkloric status hasn\u2019t been incredibly fulfilling.\n\nShawn Bradley: I just wish people had been nicer to me.\n\nReitman: When you make a movie, you hope for three things. You hope that it\u2019s good. You hope that people like it. And, above all else, you hope that it makes you a ton of fucking money. We did all three.\n",
