      "Selection": "America is no longer a majority white, Christian country.\n\nAt 45 percent of the population, white Christians are a shrinking demographic \u2014 and the backlash from many members of the group against the increasing diversification of America has been swift and bitter.\n\nThe narrator of the video, Robert P. Jones, wrote a book about this new reality called The End of White Christian America.\n\nFor most of our nation\u2019s history, White Christian America (WCA) \u2014 the cultural and political edifice built primarily by white Protestant Christians \u2014 set the tone for our national policy and shaped American ideals. But especially since the 1990s, WCA has steadily lost influence, following declines within both its mainline and evangelical branches. Today, America is no longer demographically or culturally a majority white Christian nation.\n\nTags: books\u00a0\u00a0 religion\u00a0\u00a0 Robert P.
