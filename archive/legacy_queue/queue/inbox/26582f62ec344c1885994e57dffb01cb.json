      "Selection": "The new dream job is none at all. A contingent of ambitious upper-middle-class types are devoting themselves single-mindedly to achieving early retirement, with the goal of liberating themselves from work to later travel the world or pursue a creative passion.\n\nPerhaps the contemporary quest for future unemployment stems from the fact that many jobs seem meaningless and unfulfilling. According to anthropologist David Graeber, author of the recently published book Bullshit Jobs, much work today features a lot of unnecessary busywork. Society didn\u2019t consciously design work this way, Graeber argues, but it\u2019s preventing people from making a \u201cmeaningful contribution to the world.\u201d In his 2013 essay, \u201cOn the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs,\u201d Graeber explains:\n\nHuge swathes of people, in Europe and North America in particular, spend their entire working lives performing tasks they secretly believe do not really need to be performed. The moral and spiritual damage that comes from this situation is profound. It is a scar across our collective soul. Yet virtually no one talks about it.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about it. Is your job bullshit? I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s not\u2014no matter what you do. The scar across our collective soul comes not from the work itself, but from our perceptions of meaninglessness.\n\nAny job is better than none\n\nI say this as someone who\u2019s had lots of jobs. Some were so meaningful, in fact, that I quit after a few years because the weight of working to solve serious problems became unbearable. Here is a partial list of the positions I\u2019ve held: maid, hotel receptionist, waitress, store clerk, line cook, barista, personal assistant, English teacher, writer of all kinds, lawyer of many stripes, language interpreter, translator, studio manager, and bookkeeper.\n\nHaving done all this stuff, and been unemployed on several occasions, I can safely say that the only thing worse than working is not having a job. That\u2019s a bit of wisdom my friend Kalim Shabazz shared with me when I was 28, in New York, complaining about needing meaningful work. At the time, Shabazz was a master\u2019s student in psychology at Fordham University and a DJ, and I was writing at ABCNews.com. I should have been pretty pleased, but I wanted to do something \u201creal.\u201d Reporting seemed to be merely describing the work of others.\n\nSo I joined the Peace Corps, where I had plenty of time to ponder meaning in a remote Senegalese village of 43 people, 30 of whom were small children. There, I discovered that Shabazz was right. In the village, my role was amorphous. I was supposed to help people with agroforestry and health projects, but the efforts often went awry. It\u2019s fair to say that most of the time the villagers helped me more than I did them.\n\nWhen I returned to the US, my notions about work were completely transformed. Although I\u2019ve had many jobs since, and feelings about them all, I\u2019ve done each with utter conviction for a time. My friend\u2019s wise words stayed with me.\n\nSolving puzzles\n\nIt\u2019s not the job itself that gives us a sense of purpose, but the pleasure of work. Yes, that\u2019s right. Pleasure. Because work at its best\u2014whether it\u2019s pouring coffee or defending the indigent accused in a county jail\u2014is a kind of play. In the moment of doing, meaning doesn\u2019t matter, just the task. That\u2019s a relief from spending time dwelling on the big picture: who you\u2019re meant to be and what you should try to achieve in your life.\n\nWhen we\u2019re working, we\u2019re doing what\u2019s needed, which in some jobs, some of the time\u2014like clerking at any empty hotel\u2014is just being there. When we perform our task well, we\u2019re successful in ways big and small. That feels momentarily great. Your work may not change the world. But your approach to it makes a meaningful difference in how you and those your work with, and serve, feel.\n\nThe pleasure of work \u201clies partly in flow, in the process of losing oneself in a puzzle with a solution on which other people depend,\u201d Ryan Avant argues in The Economist\u2019s 1843. He believes work is fun, and likens professionals to \u201cmaster craftsmen of the age\u201d creating \u201cbespoke\u201d products.\n\nHowever, Avant\u2019s view is limited. He believes that \u201cmiddling wage service workers\u201d don\u2019t have access to the same kind of pleasure. He takes a position similar to that of 19th century philosopher Karl Marx\u2014being occupied by \u201cgood work\u201d is living well, and purposeful occupation enables people to realize their full potential.\n\nIt would be fantastic if we all found our best and highest use on the job. But dismissing all service work misses an important point. The puzzle we\u2019re all constantly solving is survival, ideally with minimal friction and conflict and the maximum positive exchanges. When a supermarket bagger makes the effort to pack your shopping in a way that ensures the eggs don\u2019t break, or offers to carry your stuff, that\u2019s a plus. It doesn\u2019t change the course of humanity, but it sure is nice\u2014and ought to make you appreciative of the person doing the job. The bagger, with every customer, solves the puzzle of packing and earning a wage, hopefully making their portion of the world run smoothly.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s impressive when anyone does anything with verve. Just ask Michael Gates Gill, author of the 2008 riches-to-rags tale How Working at Starbucks Saved My Life. There\u2019s dignity in doing whatever must be done, according to the former advertising executive. Gill, who became a barista in his fifties, says his younger coffeeshop boss taught him an appreciation for occupation. She offered him a job interview when he was unemployed, depressed, and buying a latte as consolation\u2014not planning to ask for work. He was shocked to discover he was incredibly grateful for the opportunity, and envious of the young woman\u2019s confidence and pride in her position. He clinched the interview by describing how he\u2019d handle customers in tough situations\u2014in other words, proving that he was up to solving the puzzles that service work presents.\n\nPerhaps, as Avant himself points out in his essay, he\u2019s overly-identifying with his great writing job. For him, work is a delightful \u201cprison\u201d he doesn\u2019t wish to escape. But work isn\u2019t exclusively satisfying when you\u2019re paid a lot and can feel a bit smug about your wonderful position.\n\nDifficult, thankless, low-paid work may be undervalued societally, but it\u2019s critical to everyone. And every job has some possibilities, not recognized by snobs. When I worked as a maid at Israel\u2019s only ski resort in the Golan Heights, it wasn\u2019t fun scrubbing toilets. But it was an interesting location and soon enough, my manufactured zeal for cleaning led to a job at the front desk, where I spent a lot of time talking to local Druze workers who I never would have met otherwise.\n\nIn a similar vein, Gill\u2019s boss at Starbucks, who grew up poor, went from barista to store manager, and she was proud of her position. She was able to help a seemingly privileged man in a fancy suit get his bearings again when he was sick and broke, although neither of them would have imagined she\u2019d ever be able to help someone like him.\n\nNo exit\n\nJohn Danaher argues in The Philosopher\u2019s Magazine that all this talk of jobs and purpose is precisely the problem with postmodern society. In his recent essay, \u201cThe Case Against Work,\u201d Danaher, a law lecturer at the National University of Ireland in Galway, contends that\u2014love it or hate it\u2014we\u2019re all obsessed with work. People either humblebrag about their busyness, or they \u201cvirtue signal\u201d defiance of the societal preoccupation with labor by boasting about work-life balance. \u201cI think we have got caught up in game that deadens our spirits and limits our horizons. We need to escape,\u201d he writes.\n\nThere\u2019s that word again\u2014escape. Instead of playing this necessary game with spirit, Danaher argues that we should understand work as \u201cbad.\u201d He\u2014like Avant and Graeber\u2014believes that only a few workers have it good, and so on behalf of all those who don\u2019t have the supreme fortune to be academics, journalists, or \u201cmaster craftsmen,\u201d everyone should consider work problematic.\n\nDanaher defines work as \u201cthe performance of an activity for economic reward or in the hope of receiving some such reward.\u201d He believes that work is bad because many employment contracts allow employers to undermine worker freedom. But because jobs are increasingly precarious, workers accept this awkward position, as we need to make a living. Then, our brains are \u201ccolonized\u201d by work, Danaher contends, contemplating employment even when we aren\u2019t paid to labor.\n\nBut as anyone who has been under- or unemployed knows\u2014which is many of us, thanks to the very vagaries of employment Danaher discusses\u2014much worse than work is worry about its absence. Struggling to figure out how to pay for food and shelter, wondering when or if you\u2019ll work again, and trying to avoid spending money leaves little mental space for creativity and is more tedious than bitching about office politics or a boring gig.\n\nFor most of us, work is necessary. Treating our working years like a kind of purgatory and dreaming of early retirement is perhaps fine if you\u2019re a magical being with a guarantee that you\u2019ll live a long time. But you probably aren\u2019t, so you\u2019re better off learning to live, work, and play now.\n\nThe answer isn\u2019t escape from a \u201cvoluntary prison,\u201d but a new way of thinking about how we spend our working days and breaks\u2014making today matter, both on the job and during time off. The quality of our lives depends, in part, on our perception of existence. Or, as William Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet when the Danish prince called his land a prison, \u201cThere is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that all jobs are so great that you should stay in them forever. You probably couldn\u2019t even if you wanted to. Change is the only constant on the postmodern career path, and job security is a thing of the past.\n\nBut working isn\u2019t inherently bad. It\u2019s labor that makes free time so great, for example, and\u2014if it\u2019s lucrative, or if you\u2019re frugal\u2014what allows you to pursue travels and passions.\n\nThe gift of contrast\n\nContrast\u2014as the Tao Te Ching teaches\u2014is key. \u201cClay is made into vessels; but it is on their empty hollowness that use depends. The door and windows are cut out to form a house; but it is on empty space, that its use depends. Everything is shaped by nothing,\u201d according to the Taoist sage Lao Tzu. Labor gives leisure time flavor\u2014it is because you hustle on the job that days off doing nothing but reading or hanging with friends are fun.\n\nMoreover, whatever your job, it has some satisfying aspects, even if only because it lets you pay your way. That is nothing to scoff at\u2014in a capitalist society, people who prize freedom can surely be pleased when they don\u2019t need the assistance of a government reluctant to give.\n\nMore than that, you have a vested interest in finding ways to appreciate even the most boring work. Perhaps with time, you will find a perfect way to spend your days. But for now, dwelling perpetually in dissatisfaction will only compound unhappiness and make you less likely to find your way.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t, in the words of transcendentalist writer Ralph Waldo Emerson, \u201cshun the rugged battle of fate, where strength is born.\u201d His classic 1841 essay \u201cSelf-Reliance\u201d scoffs at those who need to immediately and obviously succeed or be special. Instead, he exalts the \u201csturdy,\u201d someone \u201cwho in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles\u2026in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet.\u201d That admirable person, \u201cdoes not postpone his life, but lives already,\u201d according to Emerson.\n\nDisrespect for your own work can lead you to disrespect the work of others, too.  If you can only admire the few powerful people who make it big, you\u2019re dissing almost everyone and missing out on humanity\u2019s dignity.\n\nBeing adaptive is a critical life skill that\u2019s practiced at work, whatever job. Understanding this, you can take an interest in pretty much anything for some time and, as a result, become more interesting and accumulate experiences that will inform your next steps. As Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck points out, interests aren\u2019t inherently fixed. Having a growth mindset, being open, is wiser than pinning your hopes on a single passion; it makes you more resilient, creative, intelligent, and happy.\n\nEven if you\u2019re not naturally passionate about serving cranky customers, for example, or reading corporate law documents, you can discover that these puzzles, too, present fascinating discoveries and solutions. Service work is a kind of diplomacy training ground that helps you in office jobs and beyond. Doing temporary legal document review projects in New York\u2014considered by many to be the saddest drudgery of lawyering\u2014ended up leading me to a job at Google headquarters in California. There I got to read the privileged mail of some of the world\u2019s most powerful technologists, among other delicious private business records. Not only was it fascinating, it taught me all about the brave new world we live in.\n\nCultivating appreciation for the mundane is also good preparation for the dreamed-of moment of freedom. Assuming you can someday retire, you\u2019ll need to be practiced at the fine art of keeping yourself busy and fulfilled. Your empty days may be very painful if you can\u2019t manage to appreciate small pleasures.\n\nIt is what it is\n\nThe point of your work doesn\u2019t have to be earth-shattering or dramatic. It just has to matter to you because you\u2019re doing it, and some things must be done.\n\nAs the eighth-century Chinese Zen master Chao Chou told a monk who sought philosophical secrets, \u201cWash your bowl.\u201d The exchange is sometimes thought to explain the spiritual significance of simple tasks, but it\u2019s not that complex.\n\n\u201cTo attribute meaning to an event or to a lifetime of events is an expression of dissatisfaction with things as they are,\u201d writes author and Chico State University Buddhist ethics professor Lin Jensen. What Zen teaches, by contrast,  is that reality is sufficient. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to represent something else. We\u2019re here in our own right. A human being, or a garden hoe for that matter, is complete in itself,\u201d writes Jensen. He believes Chao Chou is showing the monk that everything he seeks to know or be is already present in him.\n\nWork is a game, like Danaher says. So treat it like grown-up play, not something to escape. It can be fun, but it doesn\u2019t have to be so important or representative of anything. That\u2019s okay too.\n\nGiven the precariousness of employment today, you may find yourself needing to do something new soon enough anyway. Then, when the robots take over the job you don\u2019t hate, you\u2019ll be flexible enough to figure out your next steps and do whatever else must be done with admirable aplomb.\n\nMost Popular\n",
