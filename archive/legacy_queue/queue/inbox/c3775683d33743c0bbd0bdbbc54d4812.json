But the coronavirus pandemic and the logic of social distancing have turned that on its head.\n\nThat\u2019s leading to situations like the New York City Subway tweeting a celebration of declining readership, while the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority brags about empty vehicles.\n\nMarch 17, 2019: 5,568,464\nMarch 17, 2020: 1,785,252\n\n3.7 million of you chose not to ride with us yesterday because you want to #flattenthecurve.\n\nWe miss you, but for now, we\u2019ll say: thank you for not riding with us. You\u2019re keeping NYC safer.\n\n\u2014 NYCT Subway (@NYCTSubway) March 18, 2020\n\nThis. Friends don't let friends take non-essential trips. #wmata https://t.co/x8NH2v62KX\n\n\u2014 Metro (@wmata) March 19, 2020\n\nThis is, by all accounts, exactly what America should want to see happening from its big-city transit agencies.\n\nBecause some people rely on these agencies to get to work, and because some categories of workers \u2014 health care professionals, public safety workers, and those involved in the supply chains for food, medicine, and basic cleaning supplies \u2014 are needed during this crisis, transit can\u2019t just shut down. But the whole point of mass transit is to solve the basic problem of urban geometry, you need to move a lot of people through limited space. The bus is more space-efficient than a car, and a train is even more space-efficient than a bus.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, that\u2019s great. Faced with an infectious respiratory disease for which there\u2019s no vaccine and few proven treatments, it\u2019s a catastrophe. So agencies are cutting service, actively discouraging ridership, and running what service remains in a deliberately inefficient way that violates the basic logic of mass transit. Even while all that happens, they\u2019re incurring extra expenses to regularly clean and disinfect everything.\n\nIn terms of what America needs to get through this crisis, all of that is exactly correct. The problem is these agencies need fare revenue, and without it, the basic transit infrastructure of many urban areas could collapse.\n\nBut the federal government can save the day.\n\nMass transit is facing multiple economic stresses\n\nJarrett Walker, a private consultant on mass transit issues, reported as far back as March 10 that \u201cunpublished numbers shared with me by two US West Coast agencies showed ridership losses of 30-50% from pre-crisis levels.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s from before the government started really working hard to discourage people from leaving the house and going places. More recent data indicates ridership has fallen over 80 percent.\n\nAt the same time, the American Public Transit Association reports that its agencies expect to see $1.75 billion in increased costs related to increased cleaning of transit vehicles. If in the not-too-distant future, basic supplies like masks become more widely available for drivers\u2019 use, that would be a further win for public health but a further cause of increased costs.\n\nEven as their costs go up, transit authorities could see their revenue streams dry up. Most rely on $13 billion per year in earmarked sales tax revenue generated in their service areas \u2014 much of which will vanish as a result of social distancing orders. And to the extent that agencies don\u2019t depend on that kind of revenue stream, they are typically counting on ad hoc subsidies from state and local governments, which themselves count on sales tax money that is going to be vanishing.\n\nThe risk is that even as the most acute phase of the coronavirus crisis hopefully abates, transit will enter a death spiral of lost revenue, service cuts, and ridership losses from which it\u2019s incredibly difficult to recover. Agencies will have no alternative but to respond to financial pressure by scaling back service \u2014 cutting routes, shortening hours, and reducing frequency. But cutting frequency makes a transit network much less useful, ensuring that ridership doesn\u2019t bounce back even when restrictions on activity fade away. And collapsed ridership means agencies won\u2019t have the revenue to restore service.\n\nUnless, that is, they get a bunch of money.\n\nTransit operating subsidies are highly effective stimulus\n\nThe alternative is that the federal government could give transit agencies a huge stimulus.\n\nCurrently, the federal government offers financial assistance to mass transit capital projects \u2014 building new lines \u2014 but does not subsidize transit operating costs. That\u2019s a perfectly reasonable stance to take. Transit is great, but it\u2019s also very much a local benefit that under ordinary times should be financed out of fares and local revenue.\n\nBut faced with a looming economic crisis and an urgent need for federal stimulus efforts \u2014 some of which will likely include bailouts for other industries \u2014 transit operating subsidies are an appealing choice. The logistics of getting the money out the door are easy, for starters, and the public transit industry directly supports about as many employees as the airline industry. For the duration of the crisis, maintaining little-used transit service is an urgent national priority and a simple form of financial assistance to needy individuals would be to not just finance its provision but make it free.\n\nIn the longer term, once we are hopefully in a position to try to get people out and doing things again, making sure cities have viable transit systems is an excellent way to ensure that it\u2019s possible for people to get to work without breaking the bank. At a certain point you\u2019d want to withdraw financial support, just as you wouldn\u2019t want to see Congress bailing out whole industries on a routine basis. But as long as the federal government is looking at help for corporate America, it should let transit agencies in on the action as well.\n",
