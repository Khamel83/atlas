## Overview
This document compiles key insights about building effective evaluation (eval) systems for AI products, synthesized from expert sources and practical implementations.

## Current Atlas Logging Situation - CASE STUDY

### The Problem: Log Sprawl
**Current State**: Atlas has 50+ separate log files with fragmented data:
- `service_health.log` (20,935 lines)
- `atlas_service.json.log` (5,648 lines)
- `trusted_processor.log` (472 lines, active)
- Plus 47+ other specialized log files

### Why This Is Wrong
** violates core principles from the podcast**:
1. **No single source of truth** - can't get unified view
2. **Over-engineered infrastructure** - complex logging > simple insights
3. **Focus on mechanics over outcomes** - logging everything instead of what matters
4. **Analysis paralysis** - too much data to actually review 100 traces

### What We Should Do Instead
**Based on podcast recommendations**:

1. **Pick ONE log file** that captures the essential user interactions
2. **Focus on episode processing outcomes** (success/failure, quality scores)
3. **Simplify to 4-7 key metrics** that actually matter
4. **Make it readable for human review** (not just machine parsing)

### Recommended Solution
**Create a single `atlas_evaluations.log` with format**:
```
[timestamp] CONTENT_PROCESSING: content_type, source_name, content_id, success/fail, quality_score, processing_time, error_category
[timestamp] SYSTEM_HEALTH: overall_status, queue_size, success_rate, avg_quality_by_type
[timestamp] USER_IMPACT: items_added_today, user_value_score, content_type_breakdown
```

**Where content_type includes**:
- `podcast_episode` (what we're currently seeing)
- `article` (from various sources)
- `youtube_video`
- `document` (PDFs, web pages, etc.)
- `research_paper`

**Key Insight**: The format works for ANY content type - focus on outcomes, not source specifics.

**Key Insight**: The perfect is the enemy of the good. We have enough data - we need simpler analysis, not more logs.

## Phase 1: Error Analysis - The Foundation

### Start with Reality, Not Tests
**Source: Lenny's Newsletter - Building eval systems that improve your AI product**

**Key Insight**: Most teams fail by jumping straight to writing evals. Instead, manually review at least 100 traces of your AI's actual conversations.

**Methodology**:
1. **Manual Review**: Examine ~100 real user interactions
2. **Open Coding**: Write informal notes about what's wrong
3. **Domain Expertise**: Use a "benevolent dictator" - one domain expert for consistent judgment
4. **Taxonomy Development**: Group failures into prioritized categories

**Critical Finding**: 100% of the time, when teams review traces, they discover something critical they had no idea was happening. Yet most teams never look at their data.

## Phase 2: Building Evaluators

### Two Types of Evaluators

#### 1. Code-Based Evaluators
**Use for**: Objective failures (clear right/wrong answers)
- **Implementation**: Traditional code logic
- **Advantage**: Fast, deterministic, cheap
- **Examples**: Format validation, keyword matching, structural checks

#### 2. LLM-as-a-Judge
**Use for**: Subjective failures (nuanced judgment required)
- **Implementation**: Prompt engineering for evaluation tasks
- **Critical**: Your LLM judge prompts are basically PRDs that run forever
- **Best Practice**: Force binary pass/fail decisions instead of rating scales

### Ground Truth Establishment
**Split your data**:
- **Training set**: For prompt development
- **Development set**: For iteration and tuning
- **Test set**: For final validation

**Key Metrics**: Focus on True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR), not just accuracy

---

## Phase 3: Operationalization

### Integration Strategy
**CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Create a continuous improvement flywheel
- **Pre-deployment**: Run evals on unit tests
- **Post-deployment**: Sample 100 real production traces daily
- **Goal**: Catch regressions before they ship

### Monitoring Strategy
**Dual Approach**:
1. **Testing**: Unit tests before shipping
2. **Production**: Sample real traces to catch new failure modes

---

## Practical Implementation Guidelines

### Scope Management
**You don't need hundreds of evals**
- Rarely need more than 4-7 evals
- Focus on persistent failures after prompt fixes
- Avoid the edge case trap

### Time Investment
- **Initial setup**: 3-4 days
- **Ongoing maintenance**: 30 minutes per week
- **Coffee-time review**: Once proficient, weekly review takes one coffee break

### Success Principles
1. **Fix immediately**: Don't build elaborate eval infrastructure
2. **Focus on improvement**: Goal is better product, not beautiful tests
3. **Basic counting**: Most powerful tool for prioritization
4. **Binary decisions**: Pass/fail beats rating scales every time

## Research Insights

### LLM-Assisted Evaluation Validation
**Source**: "Who Validates the Validators?" (ACM Digital Library)

**Key Finding**: LLM-assisted evaluation needs alignment with human preferences
- **Challenge**: Ensuring LLM judges match human judgment
- **Solution**: Establish ground truth with human-labeled datasets
- **Validation**: Measure alignment between LLM and human evaluators

---

## Framework Summary

### The Three-Phase Approach
1. **Error Analysis**: Ground in reality with domain expertise
2. **Evaluator Building**: Match evaluator type to failure type
3. **Operationalize**: Create continuous improvement loop

### Critical Success Factors
- **Domain expertise**: Single expert judgment > committee decisions
- **Reality-based**: Start with actual user interactions, not assumptions
- **Focused scope**: 4-7 evals > hundreds of edge cases
- **Action orientation**: Fix problems, don't just document them

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Jumping straight to writing evals without error analysis
- ❌ Using committees for initial error categorization
- ❌ Building too many evals for edge cases
- ❌ Using rating scales instead of binary decisions
- ❌ Focusing on eval infrastructure over product improvement

## Action Items for Implementation

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Collect 100 real user interaction traces**
2. **Identify domain expert for error analysis**
3. **Perform open coding on failures**
4. **Group failures into axial code categories**
5. **Build targeted evaluators for top failure modes**

### Success Metrics
- **Reduction in support tickets**
- **Improvement in task completion rates**
- **Decrease in human handoff requirements**
- **Faster iteration cycles**
