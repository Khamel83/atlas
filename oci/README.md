# Atlas OCI Optimizations

This directory contains all OCI-specific optimization components for the Atlas system, including free tier monitoring, network configuration, and storage optimization.

## Components

### Free Tier Monitoring (`free_tier_monitor.py`)
- Sets up OCI cost and usage monitoring
- Creates free tier usage tracking and alerts
- Implements OCI resource optimization
- Sets up billing alerts and cost controls
- Adds OCI service usage reporting
- Configures OCI resource cleanup automation
- Tests OCI monitoring and optimization system

### Network Configuration (`network_setup.py`)
- Optimizes OCI Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) configuration
- Configures OCI Security Lists and Network Security Groups
- Sets up OCI Internet Gateway and routing
- Implements OCI firewall rules for Atlas services
- Adds OCI load balancer configuration (if needed)
- Tests network security and performance

### Storage Optimization (`storage_optimization.py`)
- Optimizes OCI Block Volume configuration
- Sets up OCI Object Storage lifecycle policies
- Implements OCI storage cost optimization
- Adds storage performance tuning
- Tests storage optimization and performance

## Installation
