"""
OCI Storage Optimization for Atlas

This script optimizes OCI Block Volume configuration, sets up Object Storage
lifecycle policies, implements storage cost optimization, creates storage
monitoring and alerting, optimizes backup strategy, and configures storage
performance tuning.

Features:
- Optimizes OCI Block Volume configuration
- Sets up OCI Object Storage lifecycle policies
- Implements OCI storage cost optimization
- Creates OCI storage monitoring and alerting
- Adds OCI backup strategy optimization
- Configures OCI storage performance tuning
