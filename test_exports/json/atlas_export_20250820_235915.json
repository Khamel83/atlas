Discussions on the topic often fade into unhelpful aphorisms like \u201cto each her own\u201d or \u201clive and let live.\u201d After all, what is too much chintz to one person is comfortable and cozy to another. My favorite abstract painter may leave you cold or, in that proverbial art jab, look like the work of a toddler.\n\nThe subject becomes even more delicate as we discover that d\u00e9cor and art preferences aren\u2019t entirely subjective. Sociologists tell us there\u2019s a strong social component; notions of elegance have roots in class dynamics. Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder, but it can also reveal socioeconomic status. Our homes reflect, at least, as much about our peers as ourselves.\n\nStill, as Justice Potter Stewart said of pornography, most of us know poor taste when we see it. Intuitively, something just feels off. And researchers have nixed the idea that the more you\u2019re exposed to an image, the more you like it, as might happen with a pop song. Bad art, it turns out, never really grows on you.\n\nIn a study published in 2013 in the Journal of Aesthetics, for example, participants rated Thomas Kinkade \u2014 whose mass-produced artwork graces many doctors\u2019 offices \u2014 worse with repeated views, while appraisals of an admired, English Pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais remained constant. People didn\u2019t rate the artist, whose works hang in Tate Britain any higher the more they saw him. Thus, for all its slipperiness, there seems to be some accounting for taste. But how does one cultivate aesthetic judgment? Can you learn to spot beautiful things?\n\nThe art historian Maxwell L. Anderson fervently contends that you can. And, he says, it doesn\u2019t require formal training or growing up in a refined environment, although that certainly might lay the groundwork. \u201cJudging quality in art or design,\u201d Dr. Anderson said, \u201cis a skill that anybody can develop.\u201d\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Today, while I sun myself on a 72 degree December day in L.A., Eriq Gardner is here from chilly D.C. with his own, legally nuanced take on Disney\u2019s settlement of the Trump /ABC News litigation. Plus he\u2019s got a look at how Hollywood\u2019s diversity and inclusion push might fare during the incoming administration. All yours, Eriq\u2026 Tuesday Thoughts\u2026 A little more on the Disney-Trump settlement : Last night, Matt and Kim weighed in on the $15 million Disney- Trump settlement. My take is slightly different. For starters: Of course Disney settled! Did C.E.O. Bob Iger really fancy marking Trump\u2019s 100th day in office embroiled in a defamation trial over some fleeting comments from George Stephanopoulos on ABC? Facing a Republican-appointed judge\u2014who already came to the conclusion that labeling Trump a \u201crapist\u201d might be defamatory\u2014and before a jury in Florida , which swung for the president/plaintiff by 13 points? This settlement makes a ton of business sense, especially considering that ABC was probably going to pay that much in legal fees anyway. Many in the media, albeit fewer at the executive level, are arguing that the settlement will only embolden Trump and establish a harmful precedent. But Trump\u2019s litigious nature isn\u2019t exactly new or discerning. He\u2019ll sue regardless, as evidenced by yesterday\u2019s filing against pollster Ann Selzer \u2014a seemingly quixotic consumer fraud lawsuit. As for\nprecedent, a settlement technically sets none, legally speaking, and this discourse also seems to ignore ABC\u2019s last major payout, in 2017, over reports about a \u201cfinely textured beef\u201d that ABC News called \u201cpink slime.\u201d I covered that libel case in South Dakota\u2014nearly alone, while others focused on the Bill Cosby trial. I later sat on a bunch of media law panels pondering whether the hefty $177 million settlement portended something ominous. Indeed, it did usher in a wave of defamation cases, though not as predicted. Attorneys from the \u201cpink slime\u201d case later took on Fox News over 2020 election falsehoods. Who\u2019s to say that this $15 million settlement won\u2019t inspire lawsuits against conservative outlets and MAGA figures? Or against Trump, who currently finds himself, just like Stephanopoulos, facing libel litigation for falsely claiming, in his debate with Kamala Harris , that the so-called Central Park Five \u201ckilled\u201d someone in the Central Park jogger case. The real question is why Trump settled. He doesn\u2019t need the money, and was suing ABC and its star anchor to send a message. What does accepting $15 million from a $200 billion corporation, and earmarking it for a presidential library, really accomplish, besides a day or two of embarrassing news cycles for his media adversary? Why forgo a chance to put a major news organization on trial? If a nominal payment is just the cost of business in the Trump era, Disney can certainly afford that. Maybe it was Trump who fumbled this\ntime. \u2014Eriq Gardner And now for a couple of other politically inflected, early-stage First Amendment concerns\u2026 Hollywood\u2019s Diversity Villain & Streaming\u2019s Insidious Bill News and notes on two legal developments likely to spoil Christmas in Hollywood: the potential mandate of Trump\u2019s new D.E.I. antagonist at D.O.J. and a bipartisan bill that could cause real headaches for the streamers. ERIQ GARDNER When she won her Oscar in 2018, Frances McDormand perfectly captured the zeitgeist with an acceptance speech that concluded, \u201cI have two words to leave with you tonight, ladies and gentlemen: inclusion rider .\u201d Back then, of course, Hollywood was the epicenter of resistance: to Donald Trump , to sexual harassment, to the lack of race and gender diversity in entertainment. Hashtags like #MeToo and #OscarsSoWhite were buzzing on Twitter, a platform Elon Musk had not yet colonized. McDormand\u2019s proclamation seemed to crystallize the beginning of a new, hopeful commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Today, as Trump prepares to return to office, I wonder what would happen if an actress repeated those words so publicly. McDormand\u2019s cri de coeur came to mind over the weekend, after Trump nominated\nformer California G.O.P. vice chair Harmeet Dhillon to head the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division. Dhillon isn\u2019t exactly Hollywood\u2019s version of a justice warrior. While Silicon Valley was going through its own #MeToo reckoning in 2017, Dhillon\u2014who for years has made a habit of filing lawsuits related to hot-button culture war issues\u2014represented James Damore , the Google engineer who was fired after circulating a 10-page manifesto that critiqued the company\u2019s diversity initiatives and suggested that men might be more suited to certain roles in tech. The class-action suit that followed\u2014alleging discrimination against white male conservatives at Google\u2014was mocked but gained traction in court and ultimately resulted in a settlement, paving the way for actress Gina Carano \u2019s Musk-funded suit against Disney. Dhillon became a fixture on Fox News, where she inevitably caught Trump\u2019s eye. A MESSAGE FROM OUR SPONSOR FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION In All Categories Including Outstanding Drama Series YELLOWSTONE Now, Dhillon is poised to swing the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights focus rightward. Gone for now are the days of probing systemic racial biases in police departments and prisons. Instead, under her watch, expect the spotlight to shift to scrutinizing race-conscious employment practices, specifically corporate D.E.I. commitments. Some of these changes are already underway: After the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action policies at colleges last year, firms like Morgan Stanley and Walmart responded by dialing back their D.E.I. programs. Some were nudged by lawsuits from America First Legal\u2014co-headed by Trump senior advisor Stephen Miller . Others, perhaps seeing the writing on the wall, anticipated regulatory shifts with Trump back in power. But Hollywood, so far, is undeterred. Sure, Bob Iger said earlier\nthis year that Disney\u2019s mission is to entertain, not to infuse political messages into its movies. (America First has targeted Disney, among others in the industry.) But for the most part, the entertainment industry is not retreating from efforts to further diversify the ranks. That includes the Academy Awards, whose new D.E.I. rules went into effect this year. Now, in order to be eligible for the best picture Oscar, a film\u2019s producers must meet two of four \u201cinclusion standards\u201d aimed at increasing the depiction and employment of women, racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ people, and those\nwith disabilities. It\u2019s hard to gauge whether these D.E.I. programs actually work. As far as entertainment goes, the evidence is mixed. Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, using A.I. facial recognition, noted a significant uptick in screen time for nonwhite actors since 2010. Conversely, USC\u2019s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found only marginal increases in speaking roles for traditionally underrepresented races and ethnicities in studio films since 2007. Personally, I\u2019m doubtful about the real-world impact of measures like \u201cinclusion riders.\u201d When McDormand made her call to action, I couldn\u2019t help but perceive it as possibly just virtue signaling, with the potential to make the situation worse. (See what I wrote back in 2018.) Complications in employment law were apparent from the start, likely prompting attorneys to stay away from quotas and dilute any robust commitments. Regardless of their effectiveness, though, these efforts carry profound symbolic weight\u2014making them conspicuous targets for Trump 2.0. Having honed her legal acumen in California, Dhillon is undoubtedly well-acquainted with these initiatives and how to possibly dismantle them. She may soon lead reverse -discrimination lawsuits on behalf of the government, or merely weigh in with amicus support when a crucial controversy touches the appellate circuits. And even in the absence of court action, there could be investigations. She\u2019s got subpoena power. Of course, there will be\nFirst Amendment defenses, given the ties between hiring practices and expressive activity, but expect Dhillon to target these initiatives early and often. Duty of Care vs. Call of Duty Federal intervention always stirs a strong reaction, particularly in an entertainment industry that circles the wagons around free speech. At the moment, however, the response has been notably subdued regarding the Kids Online Safety Act, a bipartisan measure that spells out a \u201cduty of care\u201d for tech companies to mitigate emotional harms\u2014such as depression, substance abuse, and eating disorders\u2014that arise from the design and operation of their digital platforms. The KOSA bill has cleared the Senate, where it was co-sponsored by Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Richard Blumenthal , and Elon Musk just added his endorsement, leading to intrigue about whether the House will pass the bill in the waning days of the lame-duck session. Perhaps because the bill was prompted by congressional hearings stemming from reporting on\nMeta\u2019s knowledge of its products\u2019 risks to teens, the legislation has been most closely associated with social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok. But the bill explicitly extends to gaming and video streaming services as well, which could lead the Federal Trade Commission to scrutinize how streamers like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and YouTube algorithmically curate content for viewers. No doubt, regulatory actions of this nature will invite First Amendment challenges. In anticipation, the Motion Picture Association and some of its members have discreetly lobbied on KOSA and gotten sponsors to include a safe-harbor provision for parental controls. (Despite this, the MPA is neither outwardly for nor against the bill.) A recent version of the bill, influenced by Musk\u2019s X, explicitly mentions the First Amendment, although that\u2019s done little to assuage fears of critics like the Electronic Frontier Foundation. They worry that Andrew Ferguson \u2014Trump\u2019s nominee to replace Lina Khan as F.T.C. chair, who has vowed to \u201cfight back against the trans agenda\u201d\u2014might use KOSA to censor what he deems as harmful content for youth. (The\nagency is delegated authority to issue guidance about the safeguarding of minors as well as the power to bring enforcement actions targeting unfair and deceptive practices.) Even without KOSA, the concept of a \u201cduty of care\u201d for digital platforms is becoming a major judicial issue. Meta and TikTok face a slew of negligence cases, and A.I. platforms are under scrutiny, too. Perhaps you saw news this past week about a lawsuit over a Character.AI bot that suggested a kid murder his parents over screen time limits. Or the earlier case blaming a Game of Thrones character chatbot for a teen\u2019s tragic suicide. More obscure, but worth following, is a lawsuit against video game publishers in Georgia over the addictive nature of their games, brought by a teenager named Michael Antonetti . The discourse around the case has been enlightening. In a motion to dismiss, the defendants, including Activision Blizzard and Epic Games, argue that they\u2019re\nshielded by the First Amendment, asserting that Fortnite , Call of Duty , Minecraft , etcetera, are expressive works and thus exempt from product liability law. They contend that \u201ccontent creators have no legal duty in tort to safeguard their audiences from harms allegedly caused by consuming their content. A different rule would stifle protected expression.\u201d Antonetti\u2019s legal team counters that they aren\u2019t challenging plots or characters, but rather taking issue with how game companies are using A.I., feedback loops, microtransactions, and other technologies to manipulate users into becoming compulsive in how they spend time and money. That\u2019s product design, not expression, they assert, and the First Amendment doesn\u2019t protect that . About a week ago, the video game companies responded, arguing that the supposed distinction between \u201ccontent\u201d and \u201cnon-expressive defective features\u201d is false, has never been drawn by\nany court, and would have broad implications across media. They draw parallels to literary and musical techniques designed to engage audiences, such as chapter-ending cliffhangers and catchy song choruses, noting that there\u2019s no duty to warn about these either. While the debate over KOSA has been muted so far, those paying attention see the video game addiction case as a harbinger. As the legal environment currently stands, Activision and Epic should be deemed heavy favorites\u2014however, if KOSA passes and imposes explicit duties of care regarding the more manipulative elements of media, we may see a surge in similar lawsuits. Courts would then have to navigate the delicate balance between product design and expressive content, especially when algorithms are involved. Except next time, the plaintiff might not be a teenager from Georgia, but someone Trump has appointed to police the marketplace.

Eskin is the vice-president of programming for WFAN , the New York sports talk radio station that is the nation\u2019s largest, and is also the vice-president of programming for CBS Sports Radio . Eskin is also the creator and host of The Rights to Ricky Sanchez , a podcast about the Philadelphia 76ers that is the largest team-centric podcast in the NBA. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about content and its relationship to different mediums lately, which is what brought Eskin to mind: what makes a successful radio show? Is it the same or different than podcasts, and is that generalizable to other forms of media? We touched on all of these topics, including the difference between mass media and niches, how you build stars, and why everything on the Internet is a customer acquisition challenge.

On to the interview: An Interview with Spike Eskin About Radio, Podcasts, and Internet Stars This interview is lightly edited for clarity. Topics: Background | Understanding Radio | The Problem with Jon Stewart | Podcasts, Niches, and Talent | The Art of the Take Background Spike Eskin, welcome to Stratechery. Spike Eskin: I\u2019m honored. Here right next to me is Tim Cook, and on the other side is Mark Zuckerberg and then there\u2019s me. (laughing) Tim Cook has not come on Stratechery. I don\u2019t think he will ever come on Stratechery, so I have to settle for you. SE: (laughing) I can imagine your regular listeners being just beleaguered, or beleaguered is the wrong word \u2014 now I\u2019m trying to use big words, I feel all this pressure on this podcast to use good words \u2014 \u201cWhy is this person here?\u201d So I\u2019m honored to be here. Thank you. I always start these interviews with the subject\u2019s background. People know who Tim Cook is, they might not know who Spike Eskin is, so tell me about you. What\u2019s your path? Your path actually, even going back to childhood is particularly interesting, so where you are, where come from, how\u2019d you end up where you are and what do you do? Your bio is obviously at the beginning of this interview, but give me the path there. SE: It\u2019ll just be easier for me to say so, as you mentioned beforehand, I am the VP of programming for WFAN and CBS Sports Radio, and I run a basketball podcast called \u201cThe Rights to Ricky Sanchez\u201d. My path here has been wild, I didn\u2019t plan to end up doing sports radio. In fact, because of how I grew up, I planned to do something completely different, and I didn\u2019t know what to do. Well, I didn\u2019t mention how you grew up, but your father is Howard Eskin , a very well-known sports radio personality \u2014 I think personality is the right word for it \u2014 in Philadelphia and yeah, I can imagine you wanting to avoid that path. SE: Yeah, and incredibly polarizing but also very successful and the first full-time sports talk host in Philadelphia. So I ended up in college not knowing what I wanted to do. I took a journalism class, which led me to the college radio station. I did sports for one or two semesters and realized that doing it made me dislike sports, and I didn\u2019t really like any of the people that I was \u2014 I didn\u2019t not like the people I was working with, but I could just tell I was different than those people. I was at Syracuse, so they all had this singular focus of it was all they ever wanted to do, and I just didn\u2019t feel that way. But the station I was doing sports radio for also did music, and I love music, and it was just fun. It didn\u2019t seem like the same intensity or competition or whatever it was, I ended up working in rock and alternative radio for the first fourteen or fifteen years of my career and then my radio station, they took it off of the signal it was on and put the sports radio station on that signal. So it got forced on you? SE: It got forced on me. What\u2019s hilarious was that they kept some of the people that were at the rock station, they did not keep me. I took that time, I could have done music radio in a different part of the country, but I was bored, I started doing my own podcast and did my own website or whatever. I found people to work for me for free, and we built this thing, I ended up getting rehired by the company that let me go to run the sports section of their website and run their social media and do one show a week. This was WIP in Philadelphia? SE: Correct, it was the station that let me go. I remember the night that I realized that I wanted to be in management and not be on the air was we hired a new nighttime host. I was bitter that I wasn\u2019t the host until I heard him, and I was like, \u201cWow, that guy\u2019s way better than me.\u201d I just didn\u2019t think I had the chops for it at the time. I had done some management in Philly and Chicago, and it seemed fun and our program director left. He left, I moved right into his office and started doing his job without anybody asking me. I was the web guy, and I started doing his job. Now there was somebody above me, so it wasn\u2019t like I was running the place. I became the interim program director, then the program director, then they got rid of the guy ahead of me and gave me the whole thing. So what does a program director do? SE: Manage the talent, manage the integration of sales into what you\u2019re doing, entire brand strategy and talent management I would say is what it is. So it\u2019s like the editor-in-chief, or maybe publisher\u2019s a better word, because you\u2019re combining the business parts and the editorial parts. SE: Yeah, and that didn\u2019t used to be the case. When I was coming up, when I started doing radio, there was this divide between sales and programming, and then there was somebody who was just an intermediary. Sometimes it was the marketing director that would integrate those things, but as the business evolved and staff went down, you had to become a lot more revenue forward. Who better, I think, to find ways to integrate clients than the person running the programming? If you have an open mind to it and you realize you need it for your job to succeed so that it\u2019s not going anywhere, then fighting those things will just \u2014 they\u2019ll still happen, you will just have less say over them, and they\u2019ll be less effective and all those sorts of things. So I think that was actually a blessing for me is being able to be that part of it. So I was the program director. I had very little experience in sports radio even though I had a lot of experience in radio, but I think my childhood and being around it, and at least I was at the station for two years before I did it, and I figured it out as I went along. When I took over the station was in a pretty precarious position. We were always the big heritage brand and we started losing to our competitor. I made some good hires and I think, tried to base things around culture and execution and those sorts of things, because I understood those and learned as I went along. We had phenomenal success, more than I could have ever dreamed, and some of it is luck, we really started to hum. The station really started to feel good and then the Eagles won the Super Bowl , and we were the flagship station of the Eagles. I think what that can do is you\u2019re going to get a lift in ratings and revenue when that happens anyway, but if you\u2019re good when that happens, it presents this massive opportunity. To actually hook people and get people used to listening. So this whole revenue thing about having to integrate it, this is all Internet downstream, right? This is because people are peeling away or were there other exogenous factors that required a different approach to programming? Well, I guess here\u2019s a broader question. You talked about having to bring revenue in, but did you have to also change the type of programming that you did compared to what it had been done before? SE: I don\u2019t know. So it is post-Internet, but I think when you\u2019re programming sports radio station, you cannot think about \u2014 it\u2019s a different product than a podcast and it\u2019s different. You can\u2019t listen to a podcast and say, \u201cWell, they\u2019re doing it that way, so we have to do more of that.\u201d I think what it presented was an opportunity to use that brand we had and have digital products that were also branches of what we did. So we will have a Phillies podcast for the times during the year where we\u2019re talking about Eagles all the time. We have an Eagles podcast, they can get a little bit more in depth and a little less surface level, those sorts of things. So the Internet was part of what we did and, of course, the social products that we had and using that as I guess marketing when the marketing money went away. I think the reason, though, that I had to become more revenue forward, or at least revenue understanding, was simply because there was just less money all over the place, and that was how the Internet changed it. For radio in general there was a lot of cash at one point, and that wasn\u2019t there anymore, so this was just the normal corporate thing where fewer people have to do more things that just pushed me into understanding it, I think, better than maybe I would have ten years prior. Understanding Radio What is different about radio and podcasts? You hinted it at a bit, but this actually fast forwarded to the core of what I want to talk to you about, because you think about it all of the time. You have someone like Spotify CEO Daniel Ek who is always talking about the size of the radio market that still remains, and how they view that as a target for what they\u2019re doing. As someone that does podcasts for obvious reasons, it\u2019s more accessible to getting access to a radio license, but it does strike me that the content is actually fairly different. Is that a correct assumption, and what is different about it? SE: Well, it depends on the podcast for sure, but yes, I think as a big picture thing it\u2019s different. Yes, penetration of radio is still very, very good and especially sports and spoken word radio. It\u2019s still unique, unduplicated content. So just thinking less about the delivery method and more about what is it, you still can\u2019t get this specific thing anywhere else. So it\u2019s different in one way when you are putting on \u2014 first of all, just the mechanics of it are different. If somebody is listening to a podcast and you\u2019re doing an interview, at no point during this interview do you have to tell anybody who you\u2019re talking to because they see it on the screen, they listen to it on purpose. Right. I just referenced the bio that\u2019s at the top. SE: Right, and it\u2019s gone, you never have to do it again. But in radio there\u2019s people tuning in every few minutes. You have to think about the average amount of time that people are listening and they\u2019re tuning in every few minutes. The other thing that you have to remember is that because so much of it, there are, of course, heavy users that listen for hours and hours and hours but a lot of people, it is their one 35 or 45-minute drive in or drive back or walk to work when there\u2019s something happening with sports and this is their one time to engage in the conversation. Because of that, where on my basketball podcast we may spend eighteen minutes talking about the eighth man on the team, that\u2019s not why somebody is tuning in. We\u2019re recording this when the Jets and the Giants played today on Sunday. So tomorrow, we have to be very careful that most of the people that are tuning in tomorrow want to hear our reactions to that, so it takes this ability to recycle your conversation. The other thing is that I still think we\u2019re unmatched in live listener interaction. There are all digital products that do do that, but we still have this large infrastructure of somebody answering the calls before they go on the air and making sure that it\u2019s a good person to talk to and all of those sorts of things. So we are a mass market product, whereas podcasts, there are some big ones obviously, but when you could take the cume (cumulative audience) for the biggest sports podcast, and that\u2019s a national thing that happens all over the place. A couple of radio stations could hit that same cume in a week that the biggest sports podcast is going to happen, so we are certainly a mass market product, we\u2019re a product that people get in the car and turn on in the middle of it. We do have at our radio station you can rewind and fast-forward and those sorts of things, but it is live, it\u2019s always happening. It is as soon as something happens, we are there reacting to it. So I think it\u2019s different, and it\u2019s just even different in presentation, it just sounds different because people expect it. I remember Bill Simmons telling this story once when he worked on [Jimmy] Kimmel, isn\u2019t that the show he worked on? Yeah, yep. SE: He was saying how they wanted to change the monologue because they were like, \u201cWell, why do we have to do it where they do a 10-minute monologue and then they sit at a desk and talk to somebody who\u2019s on a chair?\u201d They tried it different, and it turned out people were like, \u201cWhere\u2019s the monologue? Why aren\u2019t you sitting at a desk?\u201d There is some comfort in the way that we deliver it. I\u2019m sorry, these are a lot of things, there is a heritage to what we do and a thing where almost like a sports team, I used to say in Philadelphia that WIP was the fifth professional sports franchise. The way I thought about that was people grew up with their dad liking the Eagles and taking him to games and Phillies. In the same way people grew up in Philadelphia with WIP as part of their youth, and growing up it was part of the conversation, it was part of the community and FAN is the same way. I think it\u2019s hard for something, a podcast that came around five years ago or two years ago or even eight years ago to have that sort of integration into people\u2019s lives. Well, you had a throwaway line there at the beginning, which is, \u201cForget the delivery method,\u201d but to me, that seems like that\u2019s the entire bit. The delivery method, the classic line, the \u201c Medium is The Message \u201d seems to apply here, where the entire reason why radio was a big thing and why it\u2019s different from podcasts is it is live. Being live is a function of having broadcast licenses and you get lots of benefits, to your point, where after the game is on, you\u2019re not going to get a podcast \u2014 like Bless Bill Simmons, he gets podcasts out that night, but it\u2019s still a several hour delay. If I want a reaction right now, the Bucks win the title, I\u2019m stuck in traffic in Milwaukee, never been more happy to be stuck in traffic, I\u2019m listening to sports talk radio, it\u2019s amazing. But I guess the tension there is you also have to always be live so you have to worry about, \u201cWho\u2019s our overnight host? Who\u2019s our morning host? Who\u2019s these sorts of things?\u201d How can you maintain the advantages of being live while avoiding the challenges? Your bit about interactivity, I think, is a very compelling one. Because you\u2019re live, you can be interactive with your customers. It seems to me very forward-thinking to bring revenue to the conversation, but it seems like a long time radio was just radio. Now when you\u2019re thinking about relative to podcasts, how can we make always being on an advantage as opposed to a disadvantage? SE: One of the things is if you think about it backwards, a friend of mine when I was talking to him, he was from Philadelphia, lives in New York and is a, what do I call him? A \u201cinvest in stuff\u201d guy, a VC guy. He said what you have at WFAN, if it didn\u2019t exist and you told me that I had to spend to create it, I would tell you that absolutely not. There\u2019s so much infrastructure to what we do and the heritage that you would have to build, it would just never make sense to try and get there. So yeah, it\u2019s a feature and a bug at the same time. If you\u2019re looking at a balance sheet of what we do and you see all the people there that are required to have it be live 24 hours a day, you may say, \u201cDo we really need that?\u201d, but there becomes a breaking point that if we are not doing it, we are not providing what makes us great, what makes us good. Even as you\u2019re saying, I do this Sixers podcast, and even if it was my full-time job to do the Sixers podcast, they could make a trade and I could be in the car at the doctor, and if that happens then I\u2019m screwed because I can\u2019t be live immediately when that happens. The only way that you can always be ready is if you\u2019re always there. There\u2019s so much stuff like that in the world that if we started today, it wouldn\u2019t exist. Arguably, that applies to TV. It applies certainly to newspapers and newspapers is the cautionary tale: you\u2019re going to actually set up printing presses and actually carry around pieces of paper? People could just go online and get their news and in that case the economic forces overwhelmed it in reverse. Is that the long-term future for radio? How much of a difference does it make that you are in New York or you were in Philadelphia? The sports radio scene I think in small town or small markets is pretty dire, like what happened in newspapers. Is this really something that only works in the long run if you have that large market? SE: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know that answer because I feel like there\u2019s still so much of an evolution to happen. There are a lot of small market radio stations that do quite well and the reason they do quite well is because no one is serving their community as well as they are. You\u2019re not from a big city or whatever, and you are constantly reminding me that nobody talks about you guys enough, but think of places smaller than Milwaukee, right? When the Bucks play the 76ers, I have to go listen to a 76ers podcast afterwards. It\u2019s dire. SE: (laughing) But it\u2019s the truth. There are some non-public-owned radio stations, some private-owned radio stations in smaller markets that are doing well. They might not be doing as well as they were doing twenty years ago, but also as the radio consolidation has happened, there\u2019s less and less interest from a big public company to serve something like that, and private ownership of those smaller areas may do just fine. I don\u2019t know how that will evolve, I do know that I think rather than thinking about it in terms of you were saying big cities, I think it\u2019s more about the sports climate in those cities. There\u2019s nothing like the Northeast in that regard. SE: Yeah, our company Audacy has good stations all over the country, and I listen to all of them through my job, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything like the Northeast. I think they\u2019re great, we have great stations everywhere, but nowhere has the lunacy of Philadelphia, Boston, New York. Those three are pretty hardcore. Why do you think that is? Well, actually, I have a theory. So number one, I think an important factor for good sports climate is bad weather. So number one, you\u2019re grumpy and number two, you have nothing better to do than watch the sports team. Number two, which I think is unique to the Northeast is how baseball is still big there, and that takes up so much time on the calendar, that helps. But number three, the Midwest succeeds on those two points, but we\u2019re just too nice. I feel like good radio you have to be a little mean. SE: That\u2019s what I was going to say. We have a radio station in Chicago, The Score, if we put our hosts at WIP or FAN or EEI on in Chicago \u2014 because I lived in Chicago, I lived there for two years, those people would be like, \u201cWhat is wrong with these people?\u201d Yeah, they are too nice. I think it is, it\u2019s those three things. If you had asked me, I would\u2019ve said those three things are specifically what drives it. Then when you compare Boston and Philly to New York, New York\u2019s a little more transient. There\u2019s more people from other places here and there\u2019s famous people here or whatever. Boston and Philly, I think, is a level of intensity above New York because most of the people that live in Boston and Philly are from Boston and Philly. So it is just flowing through their veins and their blood in a way that the people in New York who are like that are like that. But there are a lot of people in New York who aren\u2019t like that. Well, I apologize for stealing your answer. I was suddenly inspired by me being nice or not. The Problem with Jon Stewart I want to get you off of radio because radio you\u2019re too ready to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you\u2019re too modest because you do know too much. But I\u2019m curious, this general topic about medium and content, we talked a little bit ago, there\u2019s this bit with Jon Stewart leaving Apple TV+ . There\u2019s talk about, \u201cIs it because his show wants to talk about China?\u201d Who knows. Obviously, that\u2019s a tasty morsel to talk about. We could ask Tim Cook if he were here, but we have Spike Eskin. The bigger issue to me though, and I\u2019m really curious the way you\u2019re thinking about this, is it seemed like the biggest problem is that no one watched the show, and why did no one watch the show? Is it because it was a bad show? Is it because Apple TV wasn\u2019t big enough? Or is it just that a talk show for streaming is some fundamental mismatch in a way that gets into the distinction between radio and podcasts? SE: The first thing I thought is, if Jon Stewart wants to do a show the way that he wants to do it about the things that he wants to do, he has plenty of money. He is incredibly famous. Why would he not just do it on his own? I think part of it is he is of an age where he wants to do some sort of legacy media, but he\u2019s also the personality where he wants it to be cool so he doesn\u2019t want it to be on MSNBC or something or some cable network, he wants it to be on Apple, but he doesn\u2019t want to be so cool that he just goes and does whatever he wants. If he wanted to do a talk show about China, he could do a talk show about China. It would make money and millions of people would listen or at least hundreds of thousands of people would listen. I think my guess is he\u2019s trying to do an old style thing on a new style platform, and I don\u2019t think that Apple helps him at all aside from funding it and giving him the backend money to make it happen. I\u2019m not counting his money or anything, but he must have plenty of money, I just think that if he were to hire some producers and put money into a small studio and all of those sorts of things, he could do something that people would consume and he would probably get picked up by legacy media, the quotes would get picked up and those sorts of things. I actually give Howard Stern a lot of credit because he walked away from that juice, and he\u2019s plenty happy doing what he\u2019s doing on SiriusXM. I\u2019m an enormous Howard Stern fan and I think most \u2014 I\u2019m 47, if you are a person doing what I do and you\u2019re my age, you grew up loving Howard Stern, you had to grow up loving Howard Stern. In the heyday of Stern you would go to work and everybody would be talking about it all the time, somebody would mention Howard Stern to you. As soon as he left regular radio and went to SiriusXM, it went away. Nobody happens into Howard anymore, it\u2019s just the diehards, but he\u2019s plenty of happy doing his show just for the diehards, and the show is different than when it was on the radio. I guess I\u2019m trying to even get back to what you asked why it didn\u2019t work, it didn\u2019t work because he\u2019s trying to combine two different things. He\u2019s trying to combine a new platform that, to your point, probably doesn\u2019t lend itself particularly well to talk shows, but also he wants to be able to do whatever he wants to do whenever he wants to do it, no matter what the topic is. I don\u2019t think those two things match, I am actually stunned that he wouldn\u2019t just go do it himself. You mean he\u2019d just set up a YouTube channel or something along those lines? SE: It\u2019d be so easy. People forget, I think, that he was a remarkably important person in the history of media and news. I was working at a radio station in Chicago, and I won\u2019t bore you with the details, but we changed a lot about what our morning show did because of The Daily Show, because there was this research at the time that showed, \u201cHey, 18-to-34s are getting their news from Jon Stewart, they\u2019re not going to legacy news anymore\u201d. He had a moment that was enormous, I think, culturally. I don\u2019t know how many people watch, but I can tell you that the cultural significance of it was huge. He has a huge audience, people do like him. They perceive him as a truth teller in some way, in the way that they, I think, perceive Bill Maher, but Bill Maher\u2019s doing his show on a cable station and Jon Stewart\u2019s trying to do it on Apple TV. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m seeing, and I think you\u2019re pushing at it, and it ties to your bit about, \u201cWho would start a radio station today?\u201d. It used to be that step one was build the infrastructure and then that infrastructure was a platform on which a personality could emerge, whether that be Howard Eskin or whether that be Jon Stewart or whatever it might be. In this case, cable, Comedy Central had time, they had to fill the calendar 24/7. It\u2019s like, \u201cHow can we do that? Well, there is this concept of evening talk shows which Jimmy Kimmel does and the big networks do. What can we do that\u2019s different?\u201d Then Jon Stewart comes along and that platform elevates him and then him starting with that platform becomes this huge star. The Internet, everyone has the same platform, and so in this case, the entire challenge is commanding an audience in the first place, it\u2019s customer acquisition. I think to your point, he could have leveraged the fame he gained via Comedy Central\u2019s platform to basically have the massive head start on a world of YouTube where everyone is, \u201cthe same,\u201d and what you can bring to it is your preexisting popularity and people knowing who you are and been something huge. But instead, he almost diminished himself by his desire for a platform, and that platform was tiny. SE: Yeah, he didn\u2019t need the platform. He actually would have had far more viewers if he was just on a place where everyone could get it if he was just on YouTube. The only time I ever go to Apple TV is if, I think I mentioned this to you the other day, I don\u2019t honestly know what streaming platform any show is on. Right. SE: When my wife and I watch a show, she\u2019ll say, \u201cHey, we should watch this show.\u201d Then I search which platform the show is on, and then I go to it on the TV. I don\u2019t just log into the platform and flip around and look for something. The other thing that he had when he was on TV that could make things popular was that the show would re-run probably five times a day for people that were just flipping around as, \u201cOh, it\u2019s on again.\u201d When SportsCenter used to be on, I don\u2019t know if it still is, but SportsCenter used to be on for five hours every morning. If you got up early enough, it was the night before SportsCenter that they would play for two hours or three hours, The Daily Show was probably on several times a day for people to be exposed to it. Whereas on Apple TV, they just have to \u2014 he\u2019s not taking advantage of any algorithmic advantage that YouTube would give him. What does this mean for the culture? Because you mentioned for a streaming service, this strikes me as a huge deal, which is, it requires some degree of intentionality. Maybe Netflix gets away with people just opening it and looking for something to watch, but they\u2019re the only one. We have this weird area where it used to be you could become big because you were on TV, and TV was like a star builder or a show builder or whatever it might be. So you have today the most valuable shows on streaming are still things like Friends or The Office that started out being popular on TV and then people want to relive their youth or whatever. On streaming services, again with Netflix maybe excepted, you don\u2019t get that. It has to be some degree of intentionality. Are we going to ever have stars again? SE: Well, I think you could look at music, you\u2019ve done a fair amount of talking about Taylor Swift . You could look at music, you could look at movies and you could say, well, what seems to happen is that this music specifically, I think, this democratization of it flattens the hills and valleys of popularity. You can get to a certain point and everybody\u2019s at this certain point and there\u2019s maybe one or two or three giant, giant, giant stars that everybody listens to. I think you could say the same thing probably in podcasting when you look at, there\u2019s a few haves and there\u2019s a lot of have-nots in podcasting, right? There\u2019s [Joe] Rogan, there\u2019s [Bill] Simmons, there\u2019s I guess, Marc Maron\u2019s really, really big, but there\u2019s not a ton of really, really big successful podcasters. But I do think we like talking to each other about things, and I think I miss that in terms of the television show conversation is just the conversation around shows and that fact that you go to work or school and everybody seems to have watched the same thing, and you can talk to it and react to it. I guess I don\u2019t know if any stars what will happen. Everything seems to change very, very quickly and so many of the stars that are around today are the most famous people doing it on their own, the MrBeast or whatever, they seem fantastically popular, and I have never seen anything that they\u2019ve done. That\u2019s a long answer. I have an 11-year-old boy so I\u2019ve I\u2019ve seen some MrBeast, for sure. SE: MrBeast, yeah. Podcasts and Niches But you mentioned there\u2019s no successful podcasters, and that is success as measured by how many millions of people used to watch, say, The Daily Show, which was on a relatively small channel on an obscure network. You host a podcast, \u201cThe Rights To Ricky Sanchez\u201d, it\u2019s ten years old, I think the largest team-centric podcast in the NBA, phenomenally well done. You put together these events , you have people going on road trips with you , you go to some random NBA team and you have hundreds of people buying plane tickets going there. You have these huge events, and it\u2019s interesting, because how is that not a success? But it speaks to the niche-ification of the Internet . In the context of a team-based podcast in that niche, isn\u2019t The Ricky the shining example of what success looks like? SE: Yes, but on some level the first thing is, it\u2019s not my job. It is a job I have, but it\u2019s not my primary thing, which allows us freedom to do what we want to do that maybe you wouldn\u2019t have if it was your primary focus. But I think it\u2019s a better example when you look at it this way of how hard it is, is that the number of people who have come to me, my company included, and said, \u201cLook what you have done. We should find the one of these in every city and put them all together and blah, blah, blah.\u201d Then you go, well, there\u2019s maybe four that you could say are maybe not the same but are of a level where you would go, \u201cI want to invest more time and money into elevating this,\u201d but finding one in every city that can achieve not even our success, take half of our success, it\u2019s impossible. They don\u2019t exist. So yes, we are an example of it being successful, but also the reality of there\u2019s not very many of them. Podcasting has been around for a good deal of time now, and it seems like now there\u2019s even too many of them for what happened to us to happen to somebody else. So I think as much as we are of an example of a success, we are an example of how hard it is to be a success as well. Basically, what you\u2019re saying is leave aside the medium, leave aside everything else, the scarce resource is talent, and even if everyone has a chance, there\u2019s just not enough talent in the world? SE: Well, talent, and I\u2019m not being modest when I say that we were very lucky. I understand I\u2019m very proud of what we\u2019ve done with our podcast, but we did start at a time with a team that made specifically provided opportunities for us. We started over ten years ago, there just weren\u2019t nearly as many podcasts. We started with a team that was rebuilding, so nobody was talking about us on the radio. So if you wanted to hear about this team, you had to come to us. The 76ers, yeah. SE: Then it was hosted by a person. My partner is a comedy writer, so he brings one thing to it but because I\u2019m a broadcaster and because I\u2019ve gone through all of this stuff about sports, radio marketing and sales and all of these sorts of things and event planning, I have exposure to these things that most people don\u2019t. So when most people want to sell their podcast, they have to go to an agency that is going to give them, let\u2019s say, 65 or 70% of the revenue, but they also have exclusive rights to sell the commercials. They\u2019re selling commercials because, let\u2019s say, there\u2019s only six commercials they can sell a week and that\u2019s not a business for somebody else, they\u2019re also selling commercials for thirty other podcasts, and half of their inventory gets unsold every year, so it\u2019s not a real revenue source. I was lucky, I know how to do sales, and I also lucky in that I didn\u2019t even have to cold call anyone or anything. Our listeners, we have listeners that own businesses who came to us, and I knew how to make it work for them. So I think we were specifically positioned because of who we are, when we are, and what we were to make it succeed. So the talent thing is really hard because I have a music podcast too and I host it with a musician. We talk a lot about the ability to be a musician, to be great at it, you almost have to make it your career so you can have enough time to do it to be great at it, but being a musician is a bad career choice. (laughing) Right. SE: So it\u2019s the same thing with personalities and talent and these sorts of things, is this person existing on his or her own long enough to develop and grow \u2014 we didn\u2019t make any money on our podcast for the first five years we did it, not one cent, didn\u2019t sell one ad. To keep wanting to do it after five years as this side thing, it also becomes harder and harder and harder. I\u2019m going to ban you from saying, \u201cI\u2019m very lucky,\u201d going forward because I think you\u2019re actually tapping into something that\u2019s essential that you brought to the table and that just to be \u2014 now I\u2019m going to say I\u2019m lucky \u2014 I had to bring to the table, which is to succeed on the Internet, and this applies to MrBeast. It already applies to Jon Stewart, and what he was lacking, and why he didn\u2019t go this direction is just as you integrated thinking about revenue into the job of programming director because revenue had to become more central to the way you were thinking about things, that\u2019s a point I\u2019ve made about newspapers and other stuff, the type of content you make has to be simpatico with how you make money. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to cross ethical lines, but the format has to be the same or whatever it might be. Like subscription versus ads, that was a benefit of Stratechery. It turns out that my being able to write about trends on the Internet and how content is evolving and how people will pay for things, sure, I was lucky that I was one of the first people to do subscriptions, but I was able to do subscriptions because I was already thinking about this in terms of where things are going, this is the direction. I thought tons of people would follow me, and few did at all until Substack came along years later, in part because to have someone that could actually set up a website and to set up a way to collect payments and to actually think about their content production in a way that aligns to making money was rarer. There were a lot of people that could write and be interesting, but they didn\u2019t have all the pieces to put it together. SE: You said something there that I think is really important too, is that people who are creatives are usually not also good at running things. I remember we were playing a local band in Philly when I worked in rock radio called Octane. Every year, we would pick a local band to play on the radio, and we would get them opening gigs at these shows. There was a show that we had an opening gig for them, and they were all late for soundcheck. I said to their manager, I said, \u201cWhy would they be late?\u201d He said, \u201cIf they were the people who weren\u2019t late for this, they would have regular jobs. They wouldn\u2019t be banking on being a rock star if they had the ability to show up on time.\u201d I think when I think about what I do, not the podcast part, the radio part, the other thing that I have that is an anomaly is that I was talent, and I\u2019m now I\u2019m coaching talent, those two things usually don\u2019t happen. Most of the people who have my job were never on the air ever before, maybe they would\u2019ve been on the air doing something, but they weren\u2019t on the air doing sports the way that \u2014 College radio maybe back in the day. SE: Yeah, so I have a perspective, but because most of the people who end up as talent, that\u2019s just not the way their brain works. They have to have an ego that wants them to be the famous one all the time. Whereas, when you\u2019re a manager, you have to want to make the other people famous, not yourself. So yeah, I think, like you, there are specific skills that somebody like you, whatever your first core competency was working in tech would not also probably be really good at writing it and would also probably not really be good at the business part of it too, which is probably why there are so few people up until recently who are making any money on the subscription model. So is that going to be the case permanently? You mentioned until recently, there\u2019s a lot more people making money on Substack fortunately, although I\u2019m not sure how much money Substack is making. There\u2019s a lot more people on YouTube making money. Podcasts, maybe a little bit more of a challenge, it does feel like. I\u2019m a huge believer and proponent in the paid podcast model just because I think there\u2019s a lot of podcasts that could very easily achieve 1,000 hardcore listeners that will listen to every single word they say, and that could be a sustainable business, but then you have this challenge of growth. How do you grow something that is paid, and getting people to listen to podcasts in general is just really, really difficult. But are you more optimistic, generally speaking, just because you do see other folks emerging on these platforms without the benefit of a FAN? Can we launch careers without infrastructure? SE: I think the thing that they\u2019re missing, and this isn\u2019t because I do it, is that there\u2019s no one there to tell them how to be better at it. They just have to figure it out, and that\u2019s pretty hard, and most people give up. A lot of the people that I see making money, at least the influencer type people, I don\u2019t actually even understand what, and now maybe I\u2019m not supposed to as a 47-year-old man, I\u2019m not supposed to understand why they are popular or why they are making money. I also do think that some of those platforms, I wonder what the profit of the platform is like these people are making money doing it. So you mentioned Substack, who knows how much money they are making. Let\u2019s say tomorrow Substack says, \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough funding, interest rates are too high, we can\u2019t get any more funding, Substack is shut down.\u201d All of those people who now have a business who are the next day probably unable to continue their business in any way because somebody else went out of business. I guess I just wonder how long a lot of these bigger platforms like that can survive not being a profitable business. Radio is a profitable business, we make money, we make more money than we spend. Substack probably isn\u2019t, right? Yeah. SE: Probably isn\u2019t profitable right now, so how long do you go? Who knows if YouTube is profitable? Google doesn\u2019t disclose the cost, but the one point you didn\u2019t make, you mentioned MrBeast earlier, if you go back and listen to his Joe Rogan interview back in the day \u2014 he\u2019s talked about this in lots of places, that\u2019s just where I first encountered it \u2014 he was spending literally a year or two years going through and analyzing every video on YouTube that he could get his hands around what succeeded and what didn\u2019t. This gets to your self-improvement point, that\u2019s almost like that\u2019s the other piece that goes into it. The thing with the Internet generally and tech in general is you have to have some iteration cycle built in, and it\u2019s a different world of making a product once. \u201cI\u2019m going to make the most perfect products, I\u2019m going to produce it.\u201d No, you have to launch products. Apple has a famous example of this with their services where they launched MobileMe back in the day, a huge disaster, looked very pretty, didn\u2019t actually scale to the Internet. When you put something online like Apple Maps, it has to be bad to start but have an improvement function built in so you can iterate on it. Maybe that\u2019s the big difference in content today and the people that succeed. People who showed up at WIP or WFAN, they did college radio, they did small town radio, and they worked their way up that way. On the Internet, you just have to have this self-reinforcing iteration function to get better such that you can somehow survive long enough to get a large enough audience and you\u2019ve become good enough that it\u2019s something that pays off. SE: It\u2019s funny you mentioned that, when I listened to, I think I watched three minutes of a MrBeast video once and I found it really annoying, but I listened to him on Rogan. I was fascinated by that part of it, about his not just \u2014 he seems to the content he makes and thinks that it\u2019s fun and enjoys it, but his hyperfocus on what will make it popular is a very strange combination to have, to actually like what you\u2019re doing and be creative about it, but also think about why one thumbnail works and another one doesn\u2019t and be smart enough to do three different thumbnails of the same video to see which one will. It\u2019s usually not the creative person doing that. Correct. SE: It\u2019s usually somebody else in a lab. It\u2019s like this intersection of skills that we were talking about before. The Art of the Take You used to have a podcast, I want to talk about one of your old ones, which was \u201cThe Art of the Take\u201d. SE: Yes. We talk about takes a lot offline, but what is a take? How would you define it? SE: By the way, that podcast is off the Internet. You can find remnants of it on the Internet, but I have all the episodes, we pulled it off. So The \u201cArt of the Take\u201d, just real quickly was when I worked at WIP, our night show was this guy named Joe Giglio and his producer was Jack Fritz . We would sit around for an hour before their show bouncing around what his lead opinion would be for the show. Then we used to laugh and see the big guns, the Stephen A. Smiths , the Skip Baylesses , the Colin Cowherds of the world, and then we actually took it to politics too, which is why we were having fun. I don\u2019t know if it would sound quite as fun listening to it now.- Right, some stuff doesn\u2019t age. SE: Yes. So we would look at what they would say, and we would figure out whether it was a good take or not. Our original definition was it would be an opinion that would have 50% of the people agree with you and 50% of the people disagree with you to start a conversation. If you could craft an opinion that did that, that was the way in to doing it. A lot of people say, \u201cWell, you are trolling when you\u2019re doing that,\u201d and I think some people are. But to me, it\u2019s less about saying something that you don\u2019t believe that will do that, and more about thinking about all the things that you believe and picking the ones that do. We used to have these rules where, \u201cOkay, how much do you have to believe in a take to say it? Eh, 70%.\u201d So if you believe it 70% of the way, then you should say it 100% of the way, because if you hedge and say, \u201cThis could happen,\u201d well anything could happen, but if you say, \u201cIt will happen,\u201d or, \u201cIs true,\u201d that\u2019s a lot different than saying, \u201cCould be true.\u201d So that\u2019s what we would do, and we had lunatic listeners who came out with mathematical formulas for takes and all that kind of stuff. But to me that\u2019s what sports talk is about, it\u2019s about arguing about who\u2019s better. It takes you back to high school or middle school or a corner bar, and it\u2019s why some of the long-lasting arguments or the unsolvable ones, like LeBron versus Michael Jordan, because it could go on and on and on and on and on forever. There\u2019s plenty of people who think both sides, that\u2019s why they last forever. Are takes universally beneficial or are they format-constrained? Because you have this bit about radio being interactive so you can give a take and people can call in and disagree. Whereas a podcast, it\u2019s a niche. You have to appeal to a relatively small number of people and do they want to be confronted with takes that make them mad? SE: Everybody likes it whether they say they like it or not, that\u2019s the first thing. I handle the podcast different than I handle radio. I think there have been times where my nature is to say things declaratively, \u201cThat guy sucks.\u201d \u201cThat guy\u2019s great.\u201d It\u2019s just my nature. I would notice sometimes that our listeners, if I was too negative too much, they didn\u2019t like that very much. But I still think part of \u2014 I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m jumping around here \u2014 I still think having a specific opinion is meaningful. You either want the person who heard you to steal it and use it in an argument about the same thing because they agree with you, or you want them to bring it up to somebody and say, \u201cDo you believe how full of shit so-and-so is?\u201d Right. SE: That\u2019s the goal. I still think it\u2019s magic on podcasts, but I do think having that balance because not everybody on a podcast is like that, and a lot of people who go to podcasts, I think, don\u2019t really want that thing. My co-host is not like that, my co-host is not declarative. I have to push him into making a choice, which keeps me on the other side. So I think balance is important. It\u2019s a little bit different on podcasts. It\u2019s not universal, I don\u2019t think. I don\u2019t think everybody wants it all the time. Yeah, I would say, I admire the art of the take, just broadly speaking. Like people who can drop great takes and you can share a tweet and say, \u201cWow, this is a great take,\u201d in that I don\u2019t agree with it at all, but I admire the art form of it. But I do worry, it\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s like, \u201cThis is a great athlete in basketball, I am admiring from afar knowing that I can never be like that\u201d. It\u2019s not possible, and I worry that I can never be a great takesman, because I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s me personally, or if it\u2019s the format that I\u2019m in. I\u2019ve staked my reputation on trying to be right as often as possible. When I make a mistake, I feel like I have to rake myself over the coals to explain why I got it wrong. It\u2019s like whimsically looking at the \u201cArt of the Take\u201d and saying, \u201cAh, I\u2019m not sure I can do that.\u201d SE: I say at work all the time to our hosts, I say, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t not try to be right. You should try to be right, but it doesn\u2019t matter if you are.\u201d Right. SE: There\u2019s a few rules to this, nobody cares if you\u2019re right, if you\u2019re right about something bad. So if we\u2019re talking about the Jets who just played today, and Zach Wilson is our quarterback, and I am doing a show for Jets fans and every day I say, \u201cZach Wilson sucks\u201d, if Zach Wilson eventually sucks, that doesn\u2019t benefit me in any way. They\u2019ll probably be mad at me for saying it the entire time and even blame me for it or something. If you\u2019re wrong about something the listener wanting to hear you have to face that is entertaining. Our job, we\u2019re not gamblers. It\u2019s a job of a gambler to be right, it\u2019s a job of a general manager to be right, it\u2019s a job of a coach to be right, all of those things. They have to be right. You\u2019re entertainers. SE: Yeah, we\u2019re entertainers. We know more. We know a lot, but it\u2019s very hard to know. I think your reputation doing what you do, if you were wrong half the time, you would not have the reputation that you have. I\u2019d have to be approaching the business a little differently. SE: Yeah. By the way, when I was in Philadelphia, when I was managing the sports station, they gave me the conservative talk station too, and I was like, \u201cOh, this is probably just sports talk.\u201d You know what? It is not just like sports talk because all of the audience thinks the same way, they don\u2019t want to fight about their own kind of \u2014 They want to be told things that affirm what they already believe. SE: Right, and it was actually really interesting to me. Now, if the audience was 50% Democrat and 50% Republican, then a great take can exist. But when you\u2019re doing it for an audience that all thinks the same way, it\u2019s different than sports in that way. If you\u2019re talking to all Cowboys fans, you still can generate debate within Cowboys fans about whether Dak Prescott, their quarterback, is good or not. It doesn\u2019t really work the same way in politics, even though there are politicians that are great takesmen. (laughing) I can\u2019t imagine who you might be talking about, but it\u2019s funny, it still works. We\u2019re obviously referring to, I assume, Donald Trump primarily riding takes into the White House, because people would talk about it. It was must-see TV, and so he dominated the media schedule. This almost ties it all full circle, which is, in a world of where you don\u2019t have the infrastructure and infrastructure can\u2019t be a king-maker, and this is arguably the demise of the media and its king-making role in politics for a very long time , the media becomes subservient to who can drive ratings. A great takesman in this case can absolutely drive ratings. Stars and Customer Acquisition I was going to ask you about whether the future is multi-format, or is there a bit where particular content works good in a particular medium and it\u2019s constrained there? But this almost makes me think that no, the Internet is just stars, and stars on podcasts can become stars on YouTube, stars on YouTube can become stars elsewhere just because it\u2019s basically it\u2019s customer acquisition. That\u2019s all that matters in the long run if you don\u2019t have WFAN infrastructure. SE: Yeah, talent and customer acquisition are the two things. By the way, just to go back, I said it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re right or wrong, the politician we were talking about does not seem to \u2014 It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re right or wrong! SE: It doesn\u2019t matter, he says it confidently whether it comes to be true or not. Yeah, I think you\u2019re right. By the way, I look at how we do what we do. There\u2019s a certain thing in sports radio where everybody does a four-hour show, or most people do a three-hour show or a four-hour show, and we just accept that as the norm. Maybe I\u2019ve said this a bunch of times, and I don\u2019t know it\u2019s the case immediately, but maybe if I\u2019m paying somebody to do four hours in the middle of the day where nothing changes, maybe he\u2019s doing the first two hours on the radio, we\u2019re repeating the first two hours, and while we\u2019re repeating the first two hours, he is doing maybe more topic-specific things for narrow casting for podcasting. Maybe if he\u2019s in New York, he\u2019s doing a half-an-hour Mets thing, he\u2019s doing a half-an-hour Giants thing for the people who are, so we have more product to get out there. I think we could evolve in that way, too. That\u2019s basically just a function of realizing that talent is a scarce resource, so we have to leverage it as much as we can. SE: Yeah. The thing that I\u2019ve told the people above me is that our most valuable resource as a company is this talent, is this sports talent that we have, they want to get as much out of them as possible. The other thing that you realize having done it is that there is a breaking point at which you cannot do anymore, and there are diminishing returns. So if somebody\u2019s doing four hours every day, it\u2019s hard to get them to do more than that. Four hours of sports content live arguing with people all day five days a week is incredibly difficult and taxing on you mentally, so we have to figure that out too, how do we get the most out of them, but also not have it be worse, still have them be able to deliver what people want. Yeah. How much of your time is spent doing marriage counseling between hosts that are supposed to be combative for the show, but that\u2019s actually impossible to not become combative in real life? SE: I did Afternoon Drive, which was 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM for four months once in Philadelphia with two other hosts. This one host named Josh Innes and Hollis Thomas, who used to play for the Eagles. Josh was the primary host, I was the third man on the show. I would have my opinion be, or would take whatever position I needed to take based on what Josh said. So if he said X, even if I didn\u2019t think Y, I would present the case of Y to try to make the show go along. Because of that, we would argue a lot. I remember I was speaking to a class at St. Joe\u2019s University, and one of the people asked, they said, \u201cHey, you and Josh sound like you hate each other. Do you guys hate each other?\u201d I said, \u201cHere\u2019s what I want you to do tomorrow.\u201d I said, \u201cI want you to argue\u2026\u201d Sam Bradford at the time was quarterback of the Philadelphia Eagles. I said, \u201cI want you to argue about Sam Bradford for three hours. You say he\u2019s good, then your friend says he\u2019s bad. This is your best friend in the world. You\u2019ve known this person since you were a child. Argue about Sam Bradford for three hours and go to bed, wake up, call him and argue with him for Sam Bradford for another three hours of everything that you just talked about the day before that you never resolved, and did this every day. You tell me how you feel about your friend after a month. You probably need a break from them. It might sound like to people that you guys hated each other. It\u2019s just the reality of it.\u201d You\u2019re right, that marriage counseling of hosts is a very important job that I have, making sure that they understand. I always tell them, \u201cYour job is not to convince the other person that you are right. Your job is to argue enough so the audience knows the argument.\u201d If you convince him, the show\u2019s over, so he can\u2019t break. If he concedes, if he goes, \u201cYeah, you know what? You\u2019re right\u201d, we\u2019re 45 minutes into a four-hour show, we\u2019re screwed. The goal isn\u2019t to win, the goal is to show the argument. The goal is to fight, not to win. This was super interesting. What strikes me is I came into this conversation wanting to push the point that the \u201cMedium is the Message\u201d, content is different by different places. I think unfortunately, I talked myself out of it where, to your point, old media is different, but it\u2019s a function of infrastructure that was built a long time ago that no one\u2019s going to build again. Once you\u2019re on the Internet, it\u2019s like all bets are off, and yeah, everything\u2019s a customer acquisition challenge. Yeah, I\u2019m going to have to concede on this one. SE: Well, I don\u2019t think I was arguing the other side! You didn\u2019t know, but even still you convinced me. SE: (laughing) By the way, so many of these, \u201cOld guard traditional media people,\u201d are also big on the Internet, which just proves the point about talent. Colin Cowherd is a radio host, that\u2019s what he is primarily, but his opinions on the Internet, on social, also are enormous, and his podcast also is enormous. So I think sometimes the medium can be the message, but most times, I don\u2019t think it is. Spike Eskin, it was great to talk and yeah, I would wish you good luck for the Sixers, but I wouldn\u2019t mean it, so I will not do so. SE: (laughing) Thank you, man. Appreciate you having me.
